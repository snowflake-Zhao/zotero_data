Abstract Objective This study aimed at assessing the impact of surgical treatments in patients with gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs). Methods A propensity score-matched (PSM) analysis based on data in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database was used to assess the efficacy of surgical treatment in patients with GEP-NETs. Results A total of 7,515 patients diagnosed with GEP-NETs from 2004 to 2015 were evaluated from the SEER database. There were 1,483 patients in the surgery group and 6,032 patients in the non-surgery group. Compared with patients in the surgery group, patients in the non-surgery group were inclined to receive chemotherapy (50.8 %
D vs. 16.7 %) and radiation (12.9 % vs. 3.7 %) as treatment options. Multivariate Cox
regression analysis revealed higher rates of overall survival (OS) outcomes for GEP-NETs patients who had been subjected to surgery (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.483,
E 95%CI = 0.439-0.533, p < 0.001). Then, to reduce the impact of bias, a 1:1 PSM
analysis was performed for the two groups of patients. A total of 1760 patients were
T assessed and each subgroup included 880 patients. In the matched population, the
patients exhibited the ability to significantly benefit from surgery (HR = 0.455, 95%CI = 0.439-0.533, p < 0.001). The OS outcomes for radiation or chemotherapy patients who had been treated with surgery were better that those of patients who had
P not been treated with surgery (p < 0.001). In addition, it was found that the OS of
patients was not significant after rectum and small intestine surgery whereas there was a significant difference in OS after colon, pancreas, and stomach surgery on the
E patients. Patients who had been subjected to surgery in the rectum and small intestines
exhibited better therapeutic benefits. Conclusion
C Patients with GEP-NETs who are treated with surgery have better OS outcomes.
Therefore, surgery is recommended for specified selected patients with metastatic GEP-NETs.

Background
Gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs) are a heterogeneous class of rare tumors that originate from the diffuse neuroendocrine system of the pancreas and gastrointestinal tract. According to the 2019 World Health Organization (WHO) classification, GEP-NETS are categorized on the basis of Ki-67 proliferation index, the primary tumor site, cell type, molecular genetic markers, and tumor differentiation.
The GEP-NETs are classified as well differentiated NETs: NET G1 (Ki-67< 3 %), NET G2 (Ki-67 3-20 %), NET G3 (Ki-67>20 %) and poorly differentiated neuroendocrine tumor carcinoma (NEC), all with Ki-67 proliferation index > 20 %1. Globally, there has been a steady increase in annual incidences of GEP-NETs 2, whose aggressive nature is associated with poor prognostic outcomes3. Even though the
D increased incidence may be due to improved detection and an aging population, there
are other unknown contributing factors4. In the last few decades, the overall survival outcomes for patients with NETs have also improved. Resection of the primary tumor
E in metastatic GEP-NETs is still an ongoing discussion. Due to progression or
intolerance to chemotherapy regimens, the available treatment options for patients
T with advanced GEP-NETs are often limited, therefore, combination immunotherapy is
recommended for such patients5. For localized, non-metastatic disease, and advanced cancer patients at initial diagnosis, surgical intervention is the next best option to systemic chemotherapy, with a 5-year survival rate of 57 % for G3 GEP-NETs, and
P 5.2 % for small-cell tumors6. Surgery can be curative in patients with localized
disease, even with regional lymph node disease7. Therefore, surgery should be considered for all patients with regional and localized GEP-NETs, but not for
E esophageal primaries. Overall survival (OS) outcomes are better in patients who are
subjected to a combination of surgery and chemotherapy, compared with patients who are subjected to chemotherapy + radiotherapy8.
C Deng et al.9 collected clinicopathological data on patients with consecutive
limited disease stage esophageal NEC who underwent esophagectomy with regional lymphadenectomy and found that prognosis of the patients was not significantly
C improved. However, the optimal treatment option for localized disease has not been
fully established. Treatment choices in metastatic disease consist of liver surgery
Aand/or locoregional as well as ablative therapies10. In 2010, the North American
Society for Neuro Endocrine tumors (NANETS) recommended deviation from surgery for patients with metastatic disease to surgery for patients with local and regional diseases, and even specified radical resection for patients with metastatic diseases. The efficacies of surgery in different lymph node stages, different age groups, as well as clinical stages have not been fully established. There is need for high quality registered large sample size surgical data based on updated pathological classification and modern radiological staging to determine the benefits of primary resection according to primary site and staging. The probable advantages of metastatic surgery should also be confirmed. In this study, using data in Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database, we analyzed the efficacy of surgical

treatments in patients with GEP-NETs using a propensity score-matched (PSM) analysis.
Methods
Patients
Patients with GEP-NETs were identified from the SEER-13 registry database (1992-2018) with additional treatment data from the SEER-18 registry database (1975-2016) using NCI’s SEER*Stat software (version 8.3.9). Histologic codes from the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology, Third Edition (ICD-O-3), and site codes were used to examine patients with GEP-NETs, as previously reported. Based on histology, patients with GEP-NETs were diagnosed as merely primary
D malignancy. The TNM staging data were retrieved according to the following codes:
Derived AJCC Stage Group, 6th Ed. (2004-2015), Derived AJCC T, 6th Ed. (2004-2015), Derived AJCC N, 6th Ed. (2004-2015), and Derived AJCC M, 6th Ed.
E (2004-2015). Diagnostic information could only be obtained from death certificates or
autopsy reports, however, patients who had died within 1 month after the initial
T diagnosis were excluded from this study. Surgical procedures were performed to the
primary site. Primary site surgery describes a surgical procedure that removes and/or destroys primary site tissues performed as part of the initial work-up or first course of therapy. Patients with unknown pathology before surgery were excluded from this
P study. The requirement for ethical approval was waived by the institutional review
committee because the SEER database is freely available to global researchers. This population-based cohort study has been reported in line with the STROCSS criteria11,
E Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/JS9/A408 .
Study Variables
C Variables such as age (from 20-24 to 85+ years), sex (female, male), race (white,
black, and others (American Indian/AK Native, Asian/Pacific Islander)), tumor size
C (reclassified as ≤ 20, 21-40, and ≥ 41mm), SEER stage, pathology, histologic grade,
surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, survival months, and vital status for individual
Apatients were extracted from the SEER database. The SEER historic stage A
(1973-2015) was used for GEP-NETs staging: localized, regional, unstaged, and distant. Therapy classifications such as chemotherapy, surgery, and radiotherapy were obtained from SEER-specific records. Surgery was chosen using the SEER code “Reason no cancer-direct surgery”, whereas radiotherapy and chemotherapy were assessed using “radiation recode” and “chemotherapy recode” in SEER. For tumor categories, the SEER categories scheme systematically classified the subjects into four grades: grade 1 with high discrimination (G1), moderately differentiated (G2), poorly differentiated (G3), and undifferentiated or anaplastic (G4). The site recode ICD-O-3/WHO 2008 information was used to filter patients by tumor location, including the appendix, ascending colon, cecum, descending colon, hepatic flexure,

large intestines, pancreas, rectosigmoid junction, rectum, sigmoid colon, small intestines, splenic flexure, stomach, and transverse colon. Age was reclassified as ≤ 30, 31-60, and ≥ 61 years whereas the OS outcomes were defined as the primary endpoints of this study.
Statistical Analysis
The t test or chi-square test were used to compare the basic clinical characteristics of patients in surgery and non-surgery groups. Cox multivariable regression was performed to analyze the relationships between variables with OS by calculating hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs. Clinicopathologic characteristics of patient survival were analyzed by the Kaplan–Meier curve and compared using the log-rank test. To reduce the impact of baseline differences in demographic and clinical characteristics
D on the outcomes, the 1:1 propensity score matching (PSM) method was used to match
the patients in the surgery and non-surgery groups. The PSM method confirms background differences by standardized differences. The basic principle of the
E propensity score is to replace multiple covariates with one score to balance the
distribution of covariates between the treatment and control groups. To reduce
T selection bias, the confounding factors in non-randomized studies were balanced in a
manner similar to randomization. The matching factors included sex, age, race, tumor location, SEER stage, tumor stage, TNM, grade, chemotherapy and radiation. The ratio value was 1 while caliper value was 0.02. Cox multivariable regression analyses
P were conducted using SPSS, version 23 (IBM Corp) whereas OS analyses were
conducted using GraphPad Prism 8 XML project. For each analysis, p ≤ 0.05 was the threshold for significance.
E Results C Patient Characteristics
A total of 7,515 patients with GEP-NETs diagnosed between 2004 and 2015 were
C assessed from the SEER database. There were 1,483 patients in the non-surgery group
and 6,032 patients in the surgery group (Table 1). Differences in characteristics
Abetween the two groups (surgery and non-surgery), including age, tumor location,
SEER historic stage, chemotherapy, AJCC stage, TNM, grade, radiation, and tumor size were significant. Patients in the non-surgery group presented a higher proportion of tumor location (pancreas, 45.7 % vs. 24.8 %, p < 0.001; stomach, 17.3 % vs. 6.8 %, p < 0.001), SEER historic stage (distant, 73.2 % vs. 26.1 %, p < 0.001), AJCC stage (IV, 71.6 % vs. 23.4 %, p < 0.001), M (M1, 71.3 % vs. 23.3 %, p < 0.001), and CS tumor size (≥ 41, 69.6 % vs. 31.4 %, p < 0.001). Moreover, patients in the non-surgery group were more inclined to receive chemotherapy (50.8 % vs. 16.7 %) and radiation (12.9 % vs. 3.7 %), compared to those in the surgery group.

Group
Univariate analysis revealed that sex, age, race, tumor location, SEER historic stage, pathology type, TNM, stage, surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, and CS tumor size were significantly associated with OS outcomes. Further, all the significant factors from the multivariate Cox analysis were incorporated into the Cox regression model. After the interventional procedures, patients with GEP-NETs exhibited higher overall survival rates (HR = 0.483, 95% CI = 0.439-0.533, p < 0.001) (Table 2). The 1:1 PSM analysis was also performed between the groups of patients to reduce the impact of bias. The factors applied for PSM analysis based on significant p-values from univariate analysis are shown in Table 2. Ultimately, 1760 patients were assessed and each subgroup included 880 patients. The p values for all covariates were greater than 0.05, indicating that propensity scores for the two groups significantly overlapped
D (Table 3). Multivariate analysis of propensity score-matched groups showed that sex,
age, tumor location, stage, grade, and chemotherapy were significantly associated with OS (Table 4). Matched population analysis showed that patients could derive
E significant benefits from surgery (HR = 0.455, 95%CI = 0.439-0.533, p < 0.001). To
establish the effects of surgery on GEP-NETs patients in different subgroups, the
T patients were stratified by particular clinical characteristics.
Subgroup Analysis after PSM
P To assess the effects of surgery in patients at different stages, patients were assigned
into stages I, II, III, and IV. The OS outcomes were as shown in Figure 1A-1D and Table 5. Surgery was associated with reduced risk of mortality in stage I (HR = 0.366,
E 95%CI = 0.246-0.545, p < 0.001), stage II (HR = 0.358, 95%CI = 0.233-0.551,
p < 0.001), stage III (HR = 0.331, 95%CI = 0.185-0.592, p < 0.001), and stage IV (HR = 0.503, 95%CI = 0.431-0.588, p < 0.001). Moreover, surgery was associated
C with a low risk of mortality in grade I (HR = 0.484, 95%CI = 0.378-0.620, p < 0.001),
grade III (HR = 0.448, 95%CI = 0.367-0.548, p < 0.001), and grade IV (HR = 0.379, 95%CI = 0.266-0.540, p < 0.001), however, surgery was not an independent
C prognostic factor for patients in grade II (Figure 1E-1H; Table 6). The OS outcomes
for patients that had been subjected to radiation or chemotherapy and who had been
Atreated with surgery was better than that of patients that had not been subjected to
surgery (p < 0.001). The metastatic patients that had been treated with surgery did not exhibit marked improvements in their OS outcomes, therefore, surgery for patients with metastatic GEP-NETs should be done with caution (Figure 2). Then, we conducted subgroup analyses based on different tumor types. There were significant differences in colon, pancreas, and stomach surgery patients, indicating that the surgical procedures led to good prognosis (Figure S1, Supplemental Digital Content 2, http://links.lww.com/JS9/A409). Prognostic differences between patients that had been subjected to rectum and small intestine surgery were insignificant, however, they showed a trend of benefitting from surgery.

Discussion
Accurate assessment of the prognosis of GEP-NETs remains a challenge because of its rarity. Further, its treatment is a complex and inconsistent process that results in unpredictability of prognostic factors and optimal treatment. The SEER database provides researchers with a large sample size to identify factors that are related to survival of patients, with a greater statistical power in studies of rare tumors, especially when using surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy data. In this study, the PSM and multivariable regression analyses revealed that surgery improves OS for GEP-NETs patients.
Studies have reported on the advantages of surgical resection in localized and locoregional disease, however, the role of surgical resection in patients with various neuroendocrine tumor types have yet to be reported. Ishida et al.12 assessed the
D prognosis of 51 cases of gastric NEC and found that curative surgery is the sole
independent prognostic factor. Similarly, another study assessed the role of surgery for high-grade pancreatic neuroendocrine carcinoma (hgPNEC) patients in a large Nordic
E multicenter cohort and indicated that surgery improved their survival rate, therefore,
patients with metastatic hgPNEC and localized hgPNEC should be subjected to
T radical surgical treatment13. However, surgery is not recommended in some cases. A
different study analyzed data for 199 esophageal small cell carcinoma (SCC) patients and found that the survival rate was better in patients who had been subjected to systemic treatment14. Surgery, particularly in the presence of metastatic disease, may
P not provide a survival advantage for most high-grade neuroendocrine carcinoma
patients with colon and rectum diseases15. For the specified selected patients with metastatic GEP-NETs, surgery may be advantageous. For GEP-NETs with extensive
E hepatic metastases, liver-directed surgery was associated with prolonged survival
outcomes16. Meanwhile, it is essential in drug development efforts and a multidisciplinary treatment approach for patients who are not candidates for surgical
C debulking17,18. The lack of data on the significance of surgical interventions is also
mirrored in consensus guidelines. Therefore, multimodal treatments combined with chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy are recommended to reduce the risks of distant and
C local recurrence, respectively. In 2010, the recommendations of NANETS changed
from surgery for patients with metastatic diseases to surgery for patients with all local
Aand regional diseases in extrapulmonary neuroendocrine carcinomas19. However, the
European Neuroendocrine Tumor Society (ENETS) guidelines recommend surgery of primary tumors (except stage III esophageal cancer)20. The National comprehensive cancer network (NCCN) recommends adjuvant chemotherapy + radical surgery for resectable lesions, chemotherapy + locoregional radiation therapy for locoregional unresectable, and chemotherapy as well as radiotherapy for selected distant metastasis sites21. The current steady increase in incidences of GEP-NETs may be attributed to increased cross-sectional imaging, routine monitoring, as well as endoscopic examination in clinical practice. Furthermore, it may be attributed to improvement of naming and classification of these diseases 22. High-resolution endoscopy and advanced

radiological imaging techniques have resulted in a shift in discovery towards small-sized (≤10 mm) gastrointestinal NETs/carcinoids. Endoscopic resection is the preferred treatment approach for stomach, duodenum (despite gastrinoma) and rectum that are ≤10 mm in size, without infiltrates of muscularis propria (T1) and no vascular infiltrations (V0, L0), whereas small tumor sizes (≤ 1 cm) in the jejunum or ileum must be removed by lymph node dissection23. Therefore, endoscopic resection should strictly follow the indications, especially in digestive system tumors. Resection of the primary focus can improve the prognosis of low-grade metastatic NET patients24. Treatment options for G3 NET and NEC have not been fully established. The available treatment methods for GEP-NETs G3 include surgery, chemotherapy, neoadjuvant therapy, targeted therapy, somatostatin analogs (SSAs), peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT), and immunotherapy25. Treatment depends on the primary tumor site and status of metastatic organs. A previous study compared the
D effects of surgical treatments on pancreatic NETs G3 and NECs. It was found that OS
outcomes for patients with NET-G3 were significantly better when compared with those of NEC patients26. Surgery with radical intent might be an effective choice for
E patients with GEP-NETs G3 and with locoregional disease, particularly with Ki67
value ≤ 55 %27. In pancreatic NEC, patients with NET G3 should probably receive the
T same approach to surgery of the primary and metastatic disease as NET G2 patients28.
Tierney et al. showed that primary GEP-NET resection is associated with prolonged survival outcomes29. In this study, patients with GEP-NETs who were treated with surgery exhibited better OS outcomes and surgery was also recommended for
P specified selected patients with metastatic GEP-NETs. This study has some limitations. First, data on various surgical aspects, such as surgical approach and time were unavailable from the SEER database. Second, the
E Ki-67 and mitotic index factors, which are key for tumor classification in the SEER
database, were not considered in tumor classification in this study. Furthermore, several important prognostic factors, such as relapse free survival, microvascular
C invasion, vascular resection performed, R0/R1 resection, antitumor immune responses,
organ-specific and peptide receptor radionuclide therapy were not taken into consideration in this study. Surgical procedures for neuroendocrine tumors, such as
C radical resection, volume reduction, and palliative resection have various meanings.
Due to limited data, the procedures were not assessed in this study, which may have
Aresulted in bias. There are differences in the nature of surgery, such as obstruction or
bleeding, curative resection, palliation, or unmeasured confounders, which may cause bias when used in PSM. Finally, since guidelines and pathology assessments have changed over time, it is unclear what the effects of treatment changes were in our study groups, which should be investigated further. Finally, the SEER database did not offer data on comorbidity, therefore, we could not assess the effects of comorbidity on OS outcomes, which may result in bias.
Conclusion
Patients with GEP-NETs who had been treated with surgery exhibited better OS

outcomes and surgery is also suitable for the specified selected patients with metastatic GEP-NETs. Provenance and peer review Not commissioned, externally peer-reviewed.
