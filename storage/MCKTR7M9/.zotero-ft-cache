Purpose: The effect of adjuvant irradiation after mastectomy in early-stage breast cancer patients remains controversial. The present study aims to explore the clinical beneﬁt obtained from adjuvant radiotherapy among post-mastectomy pT1-2N1 breast cancer patients who received adjuvant modern systemic therapy.
Methods: Medical records of consecutive patients with pT1-2N1 breast cancer who received mastectomy in our institution between January 2009 and December 2016 were retrospectively reviewed. High-risk features consist of patient age, number of positive lymph nodes, T stage, and Ki67 index, which were developed previously at our institution using early-stage breast cancer patients after mastectomy without adjuvant radiotherapy. Differences of survival and local recurrence were compared between no-postmastectomy radiotherapy (PMRT) and PMRT group according to number of risk factors. The time-toevent curves were calculated by the Kaplan–Meier methods and compared by the logrank test. Propensity score matching (PSM) was performed to reduce the imbalances in patient characteristics.
Results: A total of 548 patients were enrolled (no-PMRT: 259 and PMRT: 289). After a median follow-up of 69 months, the 5-year rate of DFS, BCSS, and LRR in the overall cohort was 90.2%, 97.4%, and 3.6%, respectively. PMRT did not signiﬁcantly improve DFS, BCSS, and LRRFS in the whole cohort. Patients were divided into low-risk (with no or one risk factor) and high-risk (with two or more risk factors) groups. According to the univariable and multivariable analysis, high-risk group (HR = 1.81, 95% CI 1.11–2.98, p = 0.02) was demonstrated as an independent risk factor for DFS. For the high-risk group, PMRT signiﬁcantly improved DFS from 81.4% to 91.9% and BCSS from 95.5% to 98.6% and decreased the 5-year rate of LRR from 5.6% to 1.4%, respectively (p < 0.01, p = 0.05, and p = 0.06). However, no survival beneﬁt from PMRT was observed in the lowrisk group in terms of DFS, BCSS, and LRR (p = 0.45, p = 0.51, and p = 0.99, respectively). In multivariate analysis, PMRT remained an independent prognostic factor

for DFS (HR = 0.50, 95% CI 0.24–1.00, p = 0.05) in the high-risk group. After PSM analysis, the survival beneﬁt of PMRT was sustained in high-risk patients. Conclusion: PMRT signiﬁcantly improved DFS in high-risk pT1-2N1 breast cancer patients, but not in low-risk patients. Independent validation of our scoring system is recommended.

INTRODUCTION
Globally, breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in women with a growing trend in both incidence and mortality (1). On the molecular level, breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease, which could be categorized into subtypes mainly based on the presence or absence of molecular markers for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) and hormone receptors [HR, including estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor] and/or BRCA mutations (2). As a result, a multidisciplinary team is recommended to determine the optimal locoregional (surgery and radiation therapy) and systemic management strategies for breast cancer. Modern systemic therapies, including endocrine therapy for HR-positive disease, anti-HER2 therapy for HER2-positive disease, chemotherapy based on anthracycline and taxane, bone-stabilizing agents, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors for BRCA mutation carriers, and immunotherapy, have been demonstrated to signiﬁcantly improve the survival outcomes of breast cancer patients (3). Post-mastectomy radiotherapy (PMRT) is an important local treatment for breast cancer with microscopic residual disease. In general, the indications for PMRT were strongly recommended for breast cancer involving a tumor size of >5 cm, presence of more than three positive lymph nodes, or positive surgical margins (4).
However, the role of PMRT in pT1-2N1 breast cancer patients remains debated in daily clinic (5). An updated report from the Early Breast Cancer Trialists’ Collaborative Group (EBCTCG) in 2014 conﬁrmed that adjuvant PMRT signiﬁcantly reduced both recurrence and breast cancer mortality in the women with one to three positive lymph nodes (6, 7). However, this meta-analysis has been criticized for its limitations, mainly less intensive systemic therapy, limited axillary dissection in some trials, and the sub-optimal radiation techniques. The high locoregional recurrence (LRR) of 20.3% at 10 years in EBCTCG meta-analysis is also quite far from the LRR rated reported in later trials (8). In addition, the clinical beneﬁt obtained from PMRT signiﬁcantly varies with primary tumor size and number of positive lymph node. A recent study from University of Chicago showed that PMRT improved the survival prognosis among patients with 3 positive lymph nodes and tumors 2–5 cm in size, but no beneﬁcial effect for patients with 1–2 positive nodes and tumors 2 cm in size or smaller (9). Thus, investigating risk factors is critically important to identify earlystage breast cancer patients who might beneﬁt from PMRT after mastectomy (4, 10).

A number of risk factors for survival in early breast cancer patients have been reported, but the results are controversial (11). Prior to the present study, we have established a nomogram for predicting the prognosis of patients with pN0-1 breast cancer who were treated with mastectomy and without adjuvant radiotherapy (12). The model was externally validated in an independent cohort of 1,356 patients from one phase III trial (NCT00041119). Finally, pathological T stage, number of positive lymph nodes, age, and Ki67 index were found to be signiﬁcant predictors for breast cancer speciﬁc survival (BCSS) in post-mastectomy breast cancer with pN0-1. In the present study, we aim to validate whether the practical prognostic scoring system based on these four risk factors in our previous study can identify high-risk pT1-2N1 breast cancer patients who could beneﬁt from PMRT.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients’ Selection
From January 2009 to December 2016, a total of 642 consecutive newly diagnosed invasive breast cancer patients undergoing mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy or axillary lymph node dissection with pathological T1-2N1 were identiﬁed at our institution. Ninety-four patients were excluded from the present analysis for the following reasons: (1) neoadjuvant chemotherapy; (2) lack of information about tumor size, pathological type, Ki67 index, and radiotherapy; (3) pathologically diagnosed as ductal carcinoma in situ, lobular carcinoma in situ, or Paget’s disease. Finally, 548 patients were enrolled for analysis in the present study.
Adjuvant Radiotherapy
For patients treated with adjuvant PMRT, dose prescription to the chest wall (CW) and regional nodes (supraclavicular, infraclavicular with or without internal mammary lymph nodes) was 50 Gy in 25 fractions. CW irradiation was given using ﬁeld-in-ﬁeld forward-planned intensity-modulated radiotherapy using photons and regional nodes were treated using an anterior mixed photon and electron beam. The volume delineation and deﬁnition were determined according to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) guidelines (13).
Outcome’s Deﬁnitions
Disease-free survival (DFS) was deﬁned as the time from surgery to the time of the ﬁrst recurrence in the ipsilateral chest wall or in regional nodal or distant sites or death from any cause. BCSS was

deﬁned as the time from surgery till death of breast cancer. LRR was deﬁned as the time from surgery to the time of a ﬁrst recurrence in the ipsilateral chest wall or in the ipsilateral regional nodal (including axillary, supraclavicular, infraclavicular, and internal mammary lymph nodes). Followup time was calculated from the date of surgery to the ﬁrst event or last conﬁrmed date of breast cancer disease-free status.
Statistical Analysis
For categorical variables, differences between the no-PMRT and PMRT groups were evaluated by using Pearson’s chi square statistics. The time-to-event curves were calculated by the Kaplan–Meier methods and compared by the log-rank test. Hazard ratios (HRs) and corresponding 95% CIs were estimated using the Cox proportional hazards regression model. Given the difference between patients with and without PMRT, PSM was applied to balance measurable confounders. Patients were matched based on their estimated propensity using 1:1 matching via nearest method without replacement with a caliper of 0.05. All statistical tests were two-sided and p < 0.05 was considered signiﬁcant. The software package SPSS 24.0 (IBM corporation, USA) was used for analysis.
RESULTS
Baseline Characteristics
In total, 548 patients who received mastectomy and were diagnosed as pT1-2N1 breast cancer were enrolled. A total of 289 patients were treated with adjuvant PMRT, and all completed scheduled radiotherapy. The baseline characteristics of these patients are listed in Table 1. The median age at diagnosis was 56 years (range, 28–91). The median tumor size was 2.5 cm (range, 0.3–5.0) in the whole cohort. Among 455 patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy, 86.6% received anthracycline and taxane-based chemotherapy. In ER-positive patients, 89.6% received the endocrine therapy. Anti-HER2 therapy was given to 62.9% of HER2-positive patients.
As shown in Table 1, patients in the PMRT group had more risk factors including younger age, larger tumor, more axillary lymph nodes involved, and unfavorable biomarkers. Accordingly, higher portion of patients received chemotherapy in the PMRT group (p < 0.01).
Survival Outcomes in Overall Cohort and Different Subgroups
After a median follow-up of 69 months (range, 2–128), 7 patients developed LRR only, 37 patients had distant metastasis only, and 13 patients developed LRR and distant metastasis. A total of 32 patients died in the entire cohort, with 23 attributed to breast cancer. The 5-year rate of DFS and BCSS was 90.2% and 97.4%, respectively. The 5-year rate of LRR was 3.6%.
Four risk parameters, established and validated by our previous study to be independent risk factors for predicting BCSS in pN0-1 breast cancer patients receiving mastectomy,

namely, age (≤40 versus >40 years old), number of positive lymph nodes (1–2 versus 3 positive lymph nodes), T stage (T1 versus T2), and Ki67 index (≤20% versus >20%), were utilized to divide patients into a low-risk group, which was deﬁned as patients with no or one risk factor, and a high-risk group, which was deﬁned as patients with two or more risk factors. There were 286 and 262 patients in the low-risk group and highrisk group, respectively, in which 127 and 162 patients received PMRT, respectively. Five-year rates of DFS, BCSS, and LRR were 92.6% versus 87.5% (p = 0.05), 97.5% versus 97.2% (p = 0.49), and 4.1% versus 3.2% (p = 0.55) between the low- and high-risk subgroups, respectively (shown in Figure 1).
Univariate and Multivariate Analysis for Survival Outcomes
In the whole cohort, chemotherapy (Yes vs. No) and risk group (high risk vs. low risk) were found to be signiﬁcant prognostic factors for DFS (p < 0.01 and p = 0.04, respectively) by univariate analysis. By multivariate analysis, no chemotherapy (HR = 2.69, 95% CI 1.51–4.79, p < 0.01) and high-risk group (HR = 1.81, 95% CI 1.11–2.98, p = 0.02) remained independent risk factors for DFS. The detailed univariable and multivariable analysis for DFS is shown in Table 2.
Survival Beneﬁts From PMRT in Different Risk Groups
After a median follow-up of 69 months (range 2–128), 8 and 15 breast cancer deaths occurred in the PMRT and no-PMRT group, respectively. No signiﬁcant difference was found between PMRT and no-PMRT groups in terms of 5-year rate of DFS (91.7% vs. 88.8%, p = 0.13, Figure 2A), BCSS (98.5% vs. 96.4%, p = 0.37, Figure 2B), and LRR (2.7% vs. 4.5%, p = 0.19, Figure 2C).
For the high-risk group, the Kaplan–Meier survival analysis indicated that PMRT signiﬁcantly improved 5-year rate of DFS from 81.4% to 91.9% (p < 0.01, Figure 2D), BCSS from 95.5% to 98.6% (p = 0.05, Figure 2E), and LRR from 5.6% to 1.4% with marginal signiﬁcance (p = 0.06, Figure 2F). For the low-risk group, there was no signiﬁcant difference in DFS, BCSS, and LRR between PMRT and no-PMRT patients (Figures 2G–I). By multivariate analysis, chemotherapy and PMRT remained independent prognostic factors for DFS (HR = 0.27, 95% CI 0.12–0.58, p < 0.01 and HR = 0.50, 95% CI 0.24–1.00, p = 0.05, respectively) in the high-risk group. The results of univariate and multivariate survival analysis in the high-risk and low-risk groups separately are detailed in Supplementary Table 1.
Since the baseline characteristic signiﬁcantly varied between the PMRT group and no-PMRT group, we performed PSM to reduce the potentially selection bias. After PSM analysis, a total of 392 matched patients were ﬁnally included for analysis. No signiﬁcant difference was observed between PMRT and noPMRT groups in the overall cohort (shown in Supplementary Table 2). Similarly, the 5-year rate of DFS in patients treated with PMRT was comparable to those who did not receive PMRT (90.6% vs. 88.5%, p = 0.36) in overall matched cohort. Consistent with previous results, patients with more than two high-risk

factors remained a poor independent risk factor for DFS in multivariate analysis (HR = 1.81, 95% CI 1.05–3.11, p = 0.03). In addition, survival beneﬁt obtained from PMRT remained signiﬁcant among breast cancer with more than two high-risk factors after PSM (5-year rate of DFS: 92.3% vs. 82.1%, p = 0.03), while no signiﬁcant survival beneﬁt from PMRT was observed among patients presented with less than one low-risk factor after PSM (5-year rate of DFS: 89.1% versus 93.6%, p = 0.29).
In conclusion, our results were consistent before or after PSM, which further conﬁrmed that the high-risk group, deﬁned as

patients with two or more risk factors, was an independent risk factor for DFS, and PMRT should be recommended for patients in that population.
DISCUSSION
In this study, we investigated the impact of PMRT on survival outcomes among patients with T1-2N1 breast cancer treated with modern systematic therapies by using a scoring system

composed of 4 clinical–pathological risk factors. Based on the number of risk factors, we divided patients into two risk groups [low risk (0–1 risk factor) vs. high-risk (≥2 risk factors)]. In the multivariate analysis, we found that the high-risk group and chemotherapy were two independent risk factors for DFS and survival beneﬁt of PMRT was limited to the high-risk group only.
The trend in the receipt of PMRT in patients with T1-2N1 breast cancer has varied signiﬁcantly over years and utilization of PMRT has increased from 14.1% to 23.5% in Asia in recent years (14). Nevertheless, signiﬁcant controversy remains regarding the beneﬁt of PMRT or regional nodal irradiation (RNI) in this population. Prior to the present study, the DBCG 82 b&c randomized trials demonstrated lower risk of LRR and better survival outcomes with the addition of PMRT (15). However, the higher risk of LRR and suboptimal BCSS have been attributed to the less than standard systemic therapy and axillary surgery in the DBCG trials. Subsequently, McBride et al. investigated the clinical beneﬁt of PMRT among patients with T1-2N1 breast cancer and treated with mastectomy and modern systemic treatment, but no signiﬁcant difference in 5-year LRR was observed (16). Another study performed by Muhsen et al., which recruited 1,087 patients with pT1-2N1 breast cancer, found no survival beneﬁt from PMRT (17). A large sample analysis from the surveillance, epidemiology, and end results program (SEER) data also found that the survival outcomes were comparable between PMRT and no-PMRT patients in the modern era (14). Consistent with previous results, we also found that in the general population of T1-2N1 breast cancer patients, the clinical beneﬁt from PMRT in the era of modern systemic therapy was not signiﬁcant. In our cohort, adjuvant chemotherapy was prescribed to 86.2% of included patients and up to 88.5% of patients had ≥10 axillary lymph nodes removed. As a result, in the era of modern systemic therapy with adjuvant chemotherapy typically containing anthracycline and taxanes, higher proportion of HER2-positive patients receiving antiHER2 therapy, and standard adjuvant hormonal therapy in HR-positive patients, the risk of tumor recurrence has been signiﬁcantly decreased. Therefore, establishing a risk scoring system is critically important to identify early-stage breast cancer patients who might beneﬁt from PMRT after mastectomy.

A practical reference risk stratifying system appears to be essential to identify patients who would beneﬁt most from PMRT at the present time. A number of risk factors that have been identiﬁed by nomograms combining different risk factors have been developed as well (18, 19). The most representative risk factors identiﬁed were patient age, number of positive lymph nodes, histological grade, and lympho-vascular invasion (20). However, the absolute risk of LRR and survival beneﬁt from PMRT with regard to risk stratifying system in T1–2N1 patients after mastectomy remain heterogeneous. Data from SEER population claimed that the beneﬁt of PMRT was observed in patients with high-risk (2 or 3 positive nodes with tumors 2–5 cm in size) but not in patients with low-risk disease (1 or 2 positive nodes with tumors <2 cm in size) (9). A more recent retrospective study by Park et al. found that close resection margin was the only independent factor for worse prognosis among post-mastectomy patients undergoing modern systematic therapies (21). Molecular subtypes play a critical part in the decision-making of systemic therapy, but its role in tailoring local–regional radiotherapy remains undeﬁned, even though ongoing studies aim to explore this. The TAILOR RT trial sponsored by the Canadian Cancer Trials Group is investigating the role of PMRT in favorable patients with one to three positive axillary nodes who have ER-positive tumors with low-risk Oncotype DX recurrence scores (NCT03488693). Our analysis failed to recognize the molecular subtypes as a signiﬁcant prognostic factor of DFS by univariate analysis and multivariate analysis. One possible reason might be the improvement of patients’ survival with the application of comprehensive systemic therapy with almost 86.2% of patients receiving 4–8 cycles of chemotherapy of anthracycline or taxane, 62.9% of patients receiving anti-HER2 therapy in HER2-positive subtypes, and 89.6% patients receiving endocrine therapy in ERpositive subtypes in our study. Consistent with our results, a large sample study, which enrolled 1,474 postmastectomy patients staged pT1-2N1 between 2006 and 2012, showed that molecular subtypes also failed to signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the survival and local prognosis with application of optimal systemic therapy (98.1% with anthracycline or taxane chemotherapy, 95.1% with hormonal therapy in HR-positive

As yet, the molecular subtype is not included in National Comprehensive Cancer Center (NCCN) guidelines to guide the decision-making of PMRT in this population (23). Results of prospective trials are still of great importance to deﬁne the role of molecular subtypes and other more elaborate biomarkers in the decision-making of radiotherapy.
In our previous study, patients with positive or close surgical margin were excluded while age, number of positive lymph nodes, tumor size, and Ki67 index remained as independent risk factors

for BCSS in T1-2N0-1 breast cancer (12). Our results showed that beneﬁts from PMRT were disparate between different risk groups. PMRT signiﬁcantly improved DFS in the high-risk group with 2–4 risk factors while it did not improve in the low-risk group with 0–1 risk factor. Although it was a single-center experience, it provided a basis to conduct a multiple institutional study in a second phase. The randomized SUPREMO trial was prospectively designed to evaluate the role of PMRT in 1,688 women with intermediate-risk breast cancer deﬁned as T1-2N1, T3N0, or T2N0 with lymphovascular invasion and high grade who underwent mastectomy

between 2006 and 2013 (24, 25). The results of this study are expected by the end of 2023.
Recent studies incorporating information on the molecular proﬁle of breast cancer aim to further tailor radiotherapeutic decisions based on risk stratiﬁcation and potentially intrinsic radiosensitivity of different subtypes. Shao et al. conducted a retrospective cohort-based study and demonstrated that among patients with high-risk factors (T2 stage and 3 positive lymph nodes disease), PMRT prolonged over-survival only in the Luminal A subtype, but not for the triple-negative and HER2positive subgroups (26). In addition to those known prognostic biomarkers, genomic proﬁle will provide additional prognostic information to risk stratiﬁcation. However, most of these studies were retrospective; thus, the evidence was relatively low. An observational cohort study using data from the American National Cancer Database (NCDB) and SEER found that the improved survival associated with PMRT was limited to patients with a low Oncotype DX recurrence score (RS) (27). Others had reported that RS could not deﬁne the patients who will beneﬁt from PMRT or not (28). Mamounas et al. though found that a high RS predicted a higher risk of LRR in general, while such association was not established when N1 patients receiving mastectomy were further analyzed (29). At the present time, majority of the panel of 2021 SG-BCC agree that commercially

available multigene signatures (e.g., MammaPrint and Recurrence Score) should not provide a solid recommendation for deciding RNI (92%) or PMRT (89%) when prospective trials such as TAILOR RT are still ongoing (30). Most of the ongoing trials integrating genomic proﬁle are focused on ER-positive, HER2-negative tumors with one to three positive axillary nodes (31). To acknowledge the advantage of molecular and genomic proﬁle in individualizing risk in a deﬁned population, the inconvenience that other molecular subtypes are not covered by most of the trials should also be noticed. While awaiting these results, our present analysis provides a practical model of available clinical–pathological information and biomarkers in consideration of an individualized PMRT.
There are limitations of this study that need to be mentioned. First, this is a retrospective study of our institute; thus, potential selection bias could not be excluded. Second, the median followup of 69 months is relatively limited, which might underestimate the actual survival outcomes of this patient population.
In summary, our retrospective study provided a practical model to optimize the triage of PMRT in a highly debatable population, T1-2N1 breast cancer patients. The risk scoring system composed of four clinical–pathological risk factors can be applied to identify the high-risk patients who might beneﬁt from PMRT undergoing modern systemic adjuvant therapy.
