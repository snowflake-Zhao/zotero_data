ABSTRACT Purpose: The purpose of the ACS/ASCO Breast Cancer Survivorship Care Guideline is to provide recommendations to assist primary care and other clinicians in the care of female adult survivors of breast cancer. Methods: A systematic review of the literature was conducted using PubMed through April 2015. A multidisciplinary expert workgroup, with expertise in primary care, gynecology, surgical oncology, medical oncology, radiation oncology, and nursing was formed and tasked with drafting the Breast Cancer Survivorship Care Guideline. Results: A total of 1073 articles met inclusion criteria and after full text review, 237 were included as the evidence base. Patients should undergo regular surveillance for breast cancer recurrence, including evaluation with a cancer-related history and physical exam, and should be screened for new primary breast cancer. Data do not support performing routine laboratory tests or imaging tests in asymptomatic patients to evaluate for breast cancer recurrence. Primary care clinicians should counsel patients about the importance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle, monitor for post-treatment symptoms that can adversely affect quality of life, and monitor for adherence to endocrine therapy. Recommendations provided in this guideline are based on current evidence in the literature and expert consensus opinion. Most of the evidence is not sufficient to warrant a strong evidence-based recommendation. Recommendations: Recommendations on surveillance for breast cancer recurrence, screening for second primary cancers, assessment and management of physical and psychosocial long-term and late effects of breast cancer and treatment, health promotion and care co-ordination/practice implications are made.

INTRODUCTION Breast cancer is the most common non-cutaneous malignancy for women, representing
4 in 10 female cancer survivors in the U.S.1 Long-term survival is common after breast cancer treatment, with a 5-year survival rate of almost 90%2; thus addressing survivors’ unique posttreatment needs is critical to providing quality health care3.
Nearly a decade ago, two landmark publications from the Institute of Medicine (IOM) highlighted the importance of surveillance, health promotion, and assessing and managing the myriad of physical, psychological, spiritual, social and practical long-term and late effects faced by many cancer survivors after completing active treatment4, 5. Recent publications affirm the importance of addressing health, wellness and quality of life concerns of post-treatment cancer survivors 3, 6, 7. In recognition of the increasing need for information to support primary care clinicians who care for breast cancer survivors, this guideline was developed to provide recommendations to enhance the quality of clinical follow-up care for those who have completed initial treatment for female breast cancer (e.g., surgery, radiation, targeted therapy, and/or chemotherapy)8.
While many evidence-based clinical guidelines exist for diagnosis and treatment, there are few evidence-based clinical care guidelines addressing life-long follow-up care for survivors by cancer type. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) developed consensusbased guidelines for the treatment of patients with breast cancer9 which include information on recommended surveillance for cancer recurrence or new cancers. The NCCN also has symptom-specific survivorship care guidelines addressing anthracycline-induced cardiac toxicity, anxiety and depression, cognitive function, fatigue, pain, sexual function, sleep disorders, and healthy lifestyles10. In addition, the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) has guidelines for the follow-up and management of patients with breast cancer 11, 12 as well as symptom-based guidelines specific to fatigue13, chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy14, and anxiety and depressive symptoms 15 ; ASCO is also developing guidelines on

the prevention and monitoring of cardiac dysfunction in survivors of adult cancers and on the management of chronic pain. In addition, ASCO has recently endorsed the ACS guideline on prostate cancer survivorship16. The ACS/ASCO Breast Cancer Survivorship Care Guideline builds upon prior guidelines by providing comprehensive, holistic recommendations specific to post-treatment breast cancer clinical care to help primary care clinicians better manage potential long-term and late-effects, and to provide timely and appropriate screening and surveillance to improve overall health and quality of life of breast cancer survivors.
This year approximately 231,840 women will be newly diagnosed with breast cancer and an estimated 3.1 million breast cancer survivors are alive in the U.S17. The median age at diagnosis is 61 years with 43% over the age of 65, thus cancer survivorship must be managed in coordination with comorbidities associated with aging1. Approximately 61% will have localized disease where survival outcomes are highest (99% 5-year relative survival rates for localized stage breast cancer versus 25% 5-year relative survival rate for distant stage breast cancer)2.
Breast cancer treatment depends on the stage at diagnosis, size and location of the tumor, and tumor characteristics. Those who are Stage II or III at diagnosis may have more involved cancer treatment, which can result in greater likelihood and severity of the impact of treatment. Treatment generally includes two key components – treatment of the breast and local lymph nodes with surgery either with or without radiation therapy (“local therapy”) and drug treatments for cancer cells that may have spread (“adjuvant systemic therapy”) outside the breast. Surgical treatment for breast cancer includes breast conserving surgery with radiation or mastectomy with or without radiation and with or without immediate/delayed reconstruction. In women with a very high risk of contralateral cancer from inherited susceptibility (e.g., patients with mutations in BRCA1/2), contralateral prophylactic mastectomy may be performed 18, 19. Systemic therapy may precede (“neoadjuvant”) or follow (“adjuvant”) local therapy, and consists of combinations of hormonal therapy, chemotherapy and biological agents.

There is no standardized follow-up model for early stage breast cancer patients who have completed surgery, chemotherapy and radiation. Most of these women will have endocrine responsive tumors and will require endocrine therapy for a total of 5 to 10 years. Randomized trials have shown equivalent outcomes with follow-up by either the oncologist or a primary care physician20. Shared follow-up care between one or more oncologists and the primary physician is an additional possibility. However, the great majority of these patients will eventually be discharged back to their primary clinician for ongoing follow-up. It should be noted that these patients remain at risk indefinitely for complications of their previous cancer treatment. Most also remain at risk indefinitely for local and/or systemic recurrence of their breast cancer.
Gaps in post-treatment cancer survivorship resources and clinical follow-up care were identified through the work of the National Cancer Survivorship Resource Center (The Survivorship Center; http://www.cancer.org/survivorshipcenter), a collaboration between the American Cancer Society (ACS), The George Washington University (GW) Cancer Institute, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and funded by a five-year cooperative agreement from the CDC. The overarching goals of The Survivorship Center are to improve individual-, system-, and policy-level post-treatment survivorship clinical care, to develop resources to help survivors achieve optimal health and quality of life (QoL), as well as to highlight the importance of post-treatment survivorship as a public health issue8. A strategic partnership with the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) was formed to optimize consistent, evidence-based recommendations for survivorship care in patients with breast cancer.

GUIDELINE QUESTIONS:
This clinical practice guideline addresses five key areas of breast cancer survivorship
to provide recommendations on best practice in the management of adult women after breast
cancer treatment, focusing on the role of primary care clinicians and other clinicians who care
for post-treatment breast cancer survivors. The five areas covered include (1) surveillance for
breast cancer recurrence, (2) screening for second primary cancers, (3) assessment and
management of physical and psychosocial long-term and late effects of breast cancer and
treatment, (4) health promotion, and (5) care coordination and practice implications.
The Bottom Line
Recommendations for the ACS/ASCO Breast Cancer Survivorship Care Guideline
Target Population Female adult breast cancer survivors
Target Audience Primary care providers, medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, and other clinicians caring for breast cancer survivors

Inclusion of Family Recommendation 6.3 It is recommended that primary care clinicians should encourage the inclusion of caregivers, spouses, or partners in usual breast cancer survivorship care and support (LOE=0). Additional Resources: More information, including a Data Supplement with additional evidence tables, is available at www.asco.org/guidelines/xxx and www.asco.org/guidelineswiki. Patient information is available at www.cancer.net.
METHODS Methods used to develop this guideline reflect an evolving process that was influenced
by ACS screening24 and survivorship16 guidelines. Where appropriate, this guideline builds upon the recently published ASCO symptom-based guidelines for adult cancer survivors 14, 15, 25.
Panel Formation A multidisciplinary expert workgroup was formed and tasked with drafting the Breast
Cancer Survivorship Care Guideline. Workgroup members had expertise in primary care, gynecology, surgical oncology, medical oncology, radiation oncology, and nursing. In addition a cancer survivor was included to provide a patient perspective.
Literature Review The literature review began with an environmental scan of existing guidelines and
guidance developed by other organizations [e.g., NCCN9, 26, 27; ASCO 11, 14, 15, 25, 28; Long-term Follow-up Guidelines for Survivors of Childhood, Adolescent, and Young Adult Cancers of the Children’s Oncology Group (http://survivorshipguidelines.org)], specific medical centers (e.g., The University of Texas MD Anderson Clinical Tools and Resources Breast Cancer Survivorship algorithm 29, US Preventive Services Task Force22, 30, 31, the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists32, individual publications33-36, available from other countries (e.g., Australian Cancer Survivorship Centre), and from other expert panels (e.g., Breast Health Global Initiative guidelines37).

The information addresses only the topics specifically identified therein and is not applicable to other interventions, diseases, or stages of diseases. This information does not mandate any particular course of medical care. Further, the information is not intended to substitute for the independent professional judgment of the treating provider, as the information does not account for individual variation among patients. Recommendations reflect high, moderate, or low confidence that the recommendation reflects the net effect of a given course of action. The use of words like “must,” “must not,” “should,” and “should not” indicates that a course of action is recommended or not recommended for either most or many patients, but there is latitude for the treating physician to select other courses of action in individual cases. In all cases, the selected course of action should be considered by the treating provider in the context of treating the individual patient. Use of the information is voluntary.

Guideline and Conflicts of Interest The Expert Panel was assembled in accordance with ACS’s Conflict of Interest Procedures and ASCO’s Conflict of Interest Management Procedures for Clinical Practice Guidelines (“Procedures,” summarized at http://www.asco.org/rwc). Members of the Panel completed ACS’s Guidelines Development Participant Disclosure Form, ASCO’s disclosure form, and the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) Form for Disclosure of Potential Conflicts of Interest, which requires disclosure of financial and other interests that are relevant to the subject matter of the guideline, including relationships with commercial entities that are

Categories for disclosure include employment; leadership; stock or other ownership; honoraria, consulting or advisory role; speaker's bureau; research funding; patents, royalties, other intellectual property; expert testimony; travel, accommodations, expenses; and other relationships. In accordance with the Procedures, the majority of the members of the Panel did not disclose any such relationships.
RESULTS A total of 1073 articles (list is available as a supplement to this manuscript) met inclusion criteria and after full text review, 237 were included as the evidence base. Only 2% of eligible articles were rated as Level I evidence, 7% were Level IA, and 2% were Level IIA. The majority of evidence was rated as Level III (26%) and Level 0 (64%). Recommendations provided in this guideline are based on current evidence in the literature and expert consensus opinion. Most of the evidence is not sufficient to warrant a strong evidence-based recommendation. Rather, recommendations should be largely viewed as possible management strategies given the current limited evidence base and the logistical challenges of comprehensively adhering to these recommendations.

RECOMMENDATIONS SURVEILLANCE FOR BREAST CANCER RECURRENCE (Table 1: Guideline for Surveillance for Breast Cancer Recurrence and Genetic Counseling) Genetic Testing / Counseling
The guiding principle of surveillance is that it should consider a patient’s risk of recurrence, in the context of functional status and patient preferences. In asymptomatic patients, routine screening tests to detect recurrence are not recommended. However, a careful

history is often needed to assure that patients are indeed asymptomatic. Patients at a higher risk for local recurrence should have appropriate screening. History and Physical Recommendation 1.1: It is recommended that primary care clinicians (a) Should individualize clinical follow-up care provided to breast cancer survivors based on age, specific diagnosis and treatment protocol as recommended by the treating oncology team (LOE=2A); (b) Should make sure the patient receives a detailed cancer-related history and physical examination every 3 to 6 months for the first 3 years after primary therapy, every 6 to 12 months for the next 2 years, and annually thereafter by the treating oncology team (LOE=2A). Clinical interpretation: Perform periodic history and physical examination on all breast cancer survivors. In a previous ASCO guideline, ASCO recommended that all female breast cancer survivors have a detailed history and physical examination every 3 to 6 months for the first 3 years after primary therapy, every 6 to 12 months for the next 2 years, and annually thereafter in order to detect cancer recurrence at an early stage 11, 12. Frequency should be determined by the treating oncologist and be based on the individual risk profile and perspective of the patient. This can be done in collaboration with the primary care clinician. Patients should be made aware of the signs and symptoms of disease recurrence and be instructed to seek medical attention if any of the signs or symptoms occur between scheduled follow-up visits. If one or more additional oncology health care providers are following the patient, the frequency of the primary physician’s visits should be adjusted accordingly. Clinicians can recommend vaccinations to their patients with a breast cancer history as appropriate based on guidelines; they can receive flu (shot, not nasal) or pneumonia vaccine at any time, including during chemotherapy, and zoster vaccine when not receiving chemotherapy 38.

Recommendation 1.2: It is recommended that primary care clinicians (a) Should refer women who have received a unilateral mastectomy for annual mammography on the intact breast and for those with lumpectomies an annual mammography of both breasts (LOE=2A); (b) Should not refer for routine screening with MRI of the breast unless the patient meets high risk criteria for increased breast cancer surveillance as per ACS Guidelines21 (LOE=2A). Clinical interpretation: Mammography should be performed yearly on the breast treated by breast conserving surgery and on the intact contralateral breast. More frequent mammography is only warranted for evaluation or follow-up of a suspicious finding 11. Following mastectomy, the site of the reconstructed breast does not require imaging. While MRI of the breast is more sensitive than mammography, there is an increased risk of false positive findings that may lead to unnecessary additional imaging and often unnecessary biopsies. Use of MRI can only be justified if the probability of missing a cancer with mammography alone is sufficiently high. In women who have not undergone bilateral mastectomy, the use of MRI of the breasts in screening for local recurrence or a new primary cancer should be restricted to women who meet the high risk criteria by the ACS or ASCO 11, 21, 39. High risk is defined as a woman with a lifetime risk of a second primary breast cancer > 20%, such as a woman with a BRCA1/2 mutation or a very strong family history of breast cancer21.
Laboratory Tests and Imaging Recommendation 1.3: It is recommended that primary care clinicians should not offer routine laboratory tests or imaging, except mammography if indicated, for the detection of disease recurrence in the absence of symptoms (LOE=2A). Clinical interpretation: Consistent with ASCO and NCCN guidelines, routine testing with breast cancer tumor markers or imaging studies (e.g., bone scan, chest x-ray, PET-CT scans, MRI scans, biomarkers) should not be performed for screening purposes because they have not

been shown to improve survival outcomes or quality of life in asymptomatic patients 9, 11. Chest x-rays and advanced body imaging (i.e., CT, MRI, PET-CT, bone scan) should be ordered only if disease recurrence is suspected 40. Randomized trials in the 1980s comparing clinical followup to periodic advanced imaging did not demonstrate a survival advantage with advanced imaging, and did show a significant rate of false-positive findings with additional testing41-43.
Signs of Recurrence Recommendation 1.4: It is recommended that primary care clinicians should educate and counsel all women about the signs and symptoms of local or regional recurrence (LOE=2A). Clinical interpretation: Physicians should educate and counsel patients about the signs and symptoms of local or regional recurrence including new lumps (e.g., in underarm or neck), rash or skin changes on the breast or chest wall, chest pain, changes in the contour/shape/size of the breast, and swelling of the breast or arm 11. Evaluation of patient-reported symptoms is essential in detecting a recurrence as early as possible which may impact survival.
Risk Evaluation and Genetic Counseling Recommendation 1.5: It is recommended that primary care clinicians (a) Should assess your patient’s cancer family history; (b) Should offer genetic counseling if potential hereditary risk factors are suspected (e.g., women with a strong family history of cancer [breast, colon, endometrial], or age 60 or younger with triple negative breast cancer)22 (LOE=2A). Clinical interpretation: To identify those women with breast cancer who have a high risk of a second primary breast cancer and / or may have a genetic susceptibility to cancer that may affect other family members, a detailed history including key risk factors and paternal and maternal family history should be obtained for all patients. Those with a family history of breast

or ovarian cancer or with cancer in a certain age group and / or cancer type should be referred for genetic counseling for consideration of testing for hereditary predisposition to genetic mutations. Specifically, genetic counseling for consideration of testing for hereditary predisposition to gene mutations should be recommended for breast cancer survivors: with at least one grandparent of Ashkenazi Jewish heritage; younger than 50 years of age at diagnosis; with a history of ovarian cancer at any age or in any first- or second-degree relative; with a firstdegree relative with breast cancer diagnosed before the age of 50; with two or more first- or second-degree relatives diagnosed with breast cancer at any age; with a diagnosis of bilateral breast cancer; with a history of breast cancer in a male relative; or any survivor diagnosed at age 60 or younger with triple negative breast cancer22. It is important to periodically review these issues with the patient as some survivors may not have been offered genetic counseling or testing at the time of diagnosis and/or new cancer events may have occurred in the family after the initial diagnosis and treatment. Because new primary cancers may be associated with some hereditary syndromes, identifying the risk of genetic mutations in the survivor may help to formulate a prevention strategy to reduce the risk of a new cancer. In addition, this information could be helpful to family members as well.
Genetic testing should be preceded by consultation with a genetics counselor or other trained professional to assure full discussion of the risks and benefits, and to assure that other genetic syndromes beyond BRCA1 and BRCA2 breast / ovarian syndromes are considered. Depending on the hereditary gene that is identified, different screening and prevention strategies may be offered. Recommendations for alternate screening and prevention strategies depend on the specific genetic syndrome, and should be left to a trained professional in coordination with the oncology team and primary care clinician.

Recommendation 1.6: It is recommended that primary care clinicians should counsel patients to adhere to adjuvant endocrine (anti-estrogen) therapy (LOE=2A). Clinical interpretation: Endocrine therapy (tamoxifen, aromatase inhibitors, or ovarian suppression therapy) used as adjuvant systemic therapy for 5-10 years reduces the risk of recurrence and of subsequent second primary breast cancers and improves overall survival. Adherence to endocrine therapy is necessary to achieve its survival benefits. Unfortunately some women discontinue endocrine therapy because of cost, side effects and other reasons. Reported adherence for a 5 year course of therapy ranges from 50 to 92% of breast cancer patients44. Primary care clinicians should assess and encourage adherence to adjuvant endocrine therapy at each visit9.
SCREENING FOR SECOND PRIMARY CANCERS Table 2: ACS Guidelines for the Early Detection of Cancer in Average Risk, Asymptomatic Individuals
Cancer Screenings in the Average Risk Patient Recommendation 2.1: It is recommended that primary care clinicians (a) Should screen for other cancers as they would for patients in the general population; (b) Should provide an annual gynecological assessment for post-menopausal women on selective estrogen receptor modulator therapies (SERMs).45 Clinical interpretation: Women should be advised to follow the ACS screening and early detection guidelines for cervical, colorectal, endometrial, and lung cancers detailed in Table 245. Post-menopausal women taking SERMs, such as tamoxifen or raloxifene, should be advised to report any vaginal spotting or bleeding as these drugs slightly increase the risk of endometrial cancer in post-menopausal women. In the absence of abnormal vaginal spotting or bleeding, periodic imaging is not of value and may lead to unwarranted biopsies46. Discuss the risks, benefits, and limitations of screening modalities with your patients.

ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT OF PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOSOCIAL LONG-TERM AND LATE EFFECTS OF BREAST CANCER AND TREATMENT
The risk of physical long-term and late effects following therapy for breast cancer is associated with several factors, including: a) type of treatment, b) duration and dose of treatment(s) (increasing cumulative dose and duration of therapy increases the potential risk), c) specific type of chemotherapy, d) receipt of and type of hormone treatment, and e) age of patient during treatment. Modalities of treatment include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and/or endocrine therapy. Primary care clinicians should refer to the patient’s cancer treatment summary, if available, for specific drugs and doses (see Recommendation 6.1). Table 3 lists potential physical and psychosocial long-term and late effects associated with surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, hormone therapy and targeted treatment. Long-term effects are medical problems that develop during active treatment and persist after the completion of treatment; whereas, late effects are medical problems that develop or become apparent months or years after treatment is completed. Recommendations for the assessment and management of specific physical and psychosocial long-term and late effects most commonly experienced by breast cancer survivors are detailed in Table 4. Table 4: Guidelines for Assessment and Management of Physical and Psychosocial Long-term / Late Effects
Body Image Concerns Recommendation 4.1: It is recommended that primary care clinicians (a) Should assess for patient body image/appearance concerns (LOE=0); (b) Should offer the option of adaptive devices (e.g., breast prostheses, wigs) and/or surgery when appropriate (LOE: 0); (c) Should refer for psychosocial care as indicated (LOE=IA).

Clinical interpretation: Body image / appearance changes can be a major area of concern affecting 31-67% of breast cancer survivors 47. Factors such as the loss of a breast, scarring and / or lymphedema following surgery, hair loss or sexual dysfunction /chemotherapy-related early menopause, skin changes from radiation, and weight gain can all lead to changes in body image with negative implications on short and long term QoL48. These body image implications are especially relevant for young breast cancer survivors49-51. Among female breast cancer survivors who are sexually active, greater body image problems have been found to be associated with mastectomy with or without reconstruction, hair loss from chemotherapy, concern with weight change, decreased self-esteem prior to the time of cancer diagnosis, poorer mental health, and a partner's difficulty understanding one's feelings50.
Patients with radiation-associated breast/soft-tissue fibrosis should be considered for therapy with oral pentoxifylline (trental) and vitamin E52-55. A radiation oncologist should evaluate such patients to assure that the clinical findings are consistent with the radiation treatment delivered. Recurrent cancer or infection can sometimes be mistaken for radiation-associated fibrosis. Primary care clinicians should refer back to the oncologist (medical, surgical, or radiation) if they ever are uncertain about potential recurrence.
Breast reconstructive surgery should be considered in women who do not feel comfortable with the results of their initial breast surgery, whether lumpectomy or mastectomy, as there may be ways to improve symmetry or appearance. Breast forms/prostheses or bras are options that are available to survivors who have undergone mastectomy or non-breast conserving therapies, and generally require a prescription from a physician. Special lingerie, attachable nipples, and other resources can help the survivor regain self-esteem. Most insurance plans cover mastectomy prostheses and specialty bras. In addition, wigs, hats, scarves and other accessories are available for survivors who experience permanent hair loss (alopecia is a rare complication of chemotherapy), color or texture change. Women should check with their insurance company and obtain a prescription from their physicians. Breast

cancer care centers or specialists often maintain directories of resources in their community where patients can find these products.
Primary care clinicians should refer patients having body image concerns that are not corrected by above options for psychosocial care. For example, for women who experience early menopause or for those with sexual concerns, support groups, psychotherapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, couple-based interventions or sex therapy may be helpful. Couple-based interventions can promote coping skills and provide specific techniques to address body image issues56.
Lymphedema Recommendation 4.2: It is recommended that primary care clinicians (a) Should counsel survivors on how to prevent / reduce risk of lymphedema, including weight loss for those who are overweight or obese (LOE=0); (b) Should refer patients with clinical symptoms or swelling suggestive of lymphedema to a therapist knowledgeable about the diagnosis and treatment of lymphedema, such as a physical therapist, occupational therapist, or lymphedema specialist (LOE=0). Clinical interpretation: All breast cancer survivors who undergo breast surgery and / or radiation are at risk for lymphedema. This is arm, breast, or chest wall swelling as a result of a blockage of the lymphatic fluid from the arm and / or breast leading to retention of fluid and swelling. The incidence of lymphedema among breast cancer survivors varies widely57 though it is estimated that over 40% of survivors will experience lymphedema to some degree58, 59. The risk of lymphedema is much lower with sentinel lymph node dissections than with the full axillary lymph node dissection previously performed in all cases60. Lymphedema may occur immediately after treatment or develop after many years. Radiation treatment may cause or exacerbate lymphedema, especially radiation to the supraclavicular nodes or axilla61.

The degree of swelling associated with lymphedema varies widely even for those receiving similar surgery and /or radiation. In most cases, it is generally limited in extent and is not disabling. In some cases the swelling is extensive and leads to significant disability such as limitation of the ability to perform fine motor functions with the hand as well as limited range of motion of other affected joints62. In addition, the swelling may cause symptoms ranging from mild discomfort to overt pain. The swelling may be of a noticeable degree and make clothes difficult to fit, and cause pain from the added weight of the arm. The International Society of Lymphedema provides a staging system to categorize the extent of lymphedema63. Patients with lymphedema are also at greater risk for the development of cellulitis of the breast, arm or chest which, especially if not promptly treated with antibiotics, may exacerbate lymphedema.
More studies are needed in the area of lymphedema prevention above and beyond biopsy types and surgical strategies (sentinel lymph node dissections and axillary reverse mapping)64. Obesity is also a risk factor for lymphedema65, 66 so physicians should recommend weight loss for those who are overweight or obese and the importance of maintaining a normal weight (see also Recommendation 5.2). Historically patients with axillary lymphadenectomies/radiation have been advised to avoid physical activity and heavy lifting with the arm on the affected side. However, one study has shown that supervised slowly progressive resistance training is safe and effective for breast cancer survivors with regards to lymphedema development. Further, this type of physical activity may reduce the likelihood of arm swelling among breast cancer survivors at high risk for lymphedema due to having 5 or more nodes removed and in improving the symptoms and severity for those in whom the condition was already present67. While the results of this study suggest a promising intervention for lymphedema, additional research is warranted. Therefore, primary care clinicians should focus on the early identification and management of lymphedema among their patients with breast cancer68.

Patients who develop clinical symptoms or swelling suggestive of lymphedema should be referred to a therapist knowledgeable about the diagnosis and treatment of lymphedema. Depending on available resources in a community, this may be a physical69 or occupational70 therapist or a specialist therapist trained in lymphedema management.
Cardiotoxicity Recommendation 4.3: It is recommended that primary care clinicians (a) Should
monitor lipid levels and provide cardiovascular monitoring, as indicated (LOE=0); (b) Should educate breast cancer survivors on healthy lifestyle modifications, potential cardiac risk factors, and when to report relevant symptoms (shortness of breath or fatigue) to their health care provider (LOE=I). Clinical interpretation: Radiation, chemotherapy and hormonal/endocrine therapy with aromatase inhibitors have been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease in patients with breast cancer71, 72. The risk of heart disease increases in post-menopausal women, as endogenous estrogens in younger women contribute to the low prevalence of cardiovascular disease in that population. Breast cancer patients who experience treatment-related early menopause may therefore be at higher risk for heart disease than age-matched women in the general population. The chemotherapeutic agents epirubicin and doxorubicin are associated with a low but real risk of cardiomyopathy73; similarly, trastuzumab is associated with an increased risk of cardiac dysfunction, most notably when given concomitantly or after an anthracycline, as has been detailed by the European Society for Medical Oncology74. Aromatase inhibitors can raise cholesterol levels75, 76 and the risk of diabetes. Significant weight gain may lead to hypertension and insulin resistance which further elevate risk of cardiovascular disease. Primary care clinicians should monitor lipid levels and engage in cardiovascular monitoring consistent with clinical standards for other high risk populations (e.g., US Preventive Services Task Force recommendations30).

It is important to educate breast cancer survivors about lifestyle modifications, including smoking cessation, diet and exercise (see Recommendations 5.3-5.5) that may reduce risk or severity of cardiotoxicity or cardiovascular diseases generally. Patients should be advised to be aware of the potential risk for cardiotoxicities and report symptoms such as shortness of breath or fatigue (without an otherwise identifiable cause) to their health care provider. However routine screening or testing for cardiovascular disease in asymptomatic patients beyond careful history and physical examination are not warranted.
ASCO is currently developing a guideline on the prevention and monitoring of cardiac dysfunction in survivors of adult cancers.
Cognitive Impairment Recommendation 4.4: It is recommended that primary care clinicians (a) Should ask patients if they are experiencing cognitive difficulties (LOE=0); (b) Should assess for reversible contributing factors of cognitive impairment and optimally treat when possible (LOE=IA); (c) Should refer patients with signs of cognitive impairment for neurocognitive assessment and rehabilitation, including group cognitive training if available (LOE=IA). Clinical interpretation: Impairment in cognitive function as a result of cancer and its treatment can lead to distress and impaired quality of life in breast cancer survivors. Up to 75% of breast cancer patients in treatment and 35% following treatment report cognitive impairment, including problems with concentration, executive function, and memory77-79. Cognitive impairment can also have detrimental effects on the survivor’s role within the family, workplace, and in society80, 81. Clinicians should ask patients if they are having cognitive difficulties and listen to family members’ reporting of patient cognitive symptoms. If this is an issue, consultation with a neuropsychologist for assessment and referral for cognitive rehabilitation strategies should be offered as one would do with the general population.

The causes of cognitive impairment are thought to be multifactorial and may include treatable conditions, such as fatigue, insomnia, and depression. Links have been suggested between cognitive impairment and adjuvant chemotherapy82-84; surgery / anesthesia85; endocrine therapy77, 86; as well as cancer itself77. Research suggests that older adults and / or those with lower cognitive reserves may be more susceptible to cognitive impairment from treatment87 and that there may also be genetic factors associated with certain estrogen metabolism genes88, 89.
The treatment of cognitive impairment in the breast cancer survivor is not well established. A few studies have shown some success with pharmaceuticals, such as modafinil90, that have helped improve cognitive impairment, but the data are not consistent91. Cognitive rehabilitation strategies including the practice of group cognitive training (i.e., interventions geared towards improving, restoring or maintaining mental function through structured, repetitive practice of tasks posing a mental challenge or requiring the person to problem solve) has been found to be helpful at reducing cognitive impairment in breast cancer survivors92,93. Primary care clinicians should provide referral for neurocognitive assessment and rehabilitation as clinically indicated.
Distress, Depression, and Anxiety Recommendation 4.5: It is recommended that primary care clinicians (a) Should assess patients for distress, depression, and/or anxiety (LOE=I); (b) Should conduct a more probing assessment for patients at a higher risk of depression (e.g., young patients, those with a history of prior psychiatric disease, and patients with low socioeconomic status) (LOE=III); (c) Should offer in-office counseling and/or pharmacotherapy and/or refer to appropriate psycho-oncology and mental health resources as clinically indicated if signs of distress, depression, or anxiety are present (LOE=I).

Clinical interpretation: Many cancer survivors report ongoing difficulties in recovery and returning to ‘normal’ following treatment1, 2, 17, 94. Some survivors of cancer experience fear of recurrence (FOR)95, contributing to significant mental health problems for which they may already have an increased risk, including distress, depression, and anxiety96, 97. Older age and African American breast cancer survivors have been found to have less FOR. Shorter interval of time since diagnosis, having received chemotherapy, and having more symptoms, especially pain, were found to be related to higher levels of FOR98. Prevalence estimates for anxiety, depression, and distress in cancer survivors vary widely as a result of inconsistency in the use of measurement tools and differences in methodological approaches, such as the choice of comparators from the general population. The estimated prevalence of anxiety and depression is 17.9% and 11.6%, respectively, among the general cancer survivor population99. In a systematic review of observational studies, the prevalence of depression and anxiety among breast cancer survivors, specifically, was 22% (range=13-56%) using the Center for Epidemiological Studies for Depression (CES-D), 22% (range=17-48%) using the Beck Depression Inventory, and 10% (range=1-22%) using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale100.
In order to provide timely and appropriate support for their patients with a history of breast cancer, primary care clinicians should be familiar with the mental health concerns they may experience, the tools to screen for and assess these problems, and the resources to care for their patients. A tool for initial screening is the distress thermometer (http://www.nccn.org/patients/resources/life_with_cancer/pdf/nccn_distress_thermometer.pdf): 0 (no distress) to 10 (extreme distress). A score of four or higher101 suggests a level of distress that has clinical significance. The PHQ-9102 and the GAD-7103 are validated methods for screening for depression and anxiety, respectively, and are available free online at http://www.phqscreeners.com/. For patients elevated on these screeners, further discussion and assessment of the issues is needed, as in the general population. For more information on

screening and assessing adults with cancer for psychosocial distress, see the depression and anxiety algorithms in the online Appendix which is reproduced from the ASCO guidelines15.
The risk of having major depression after a diagnosis of breast cancer was higher among younger patients, patients with a history of prior psychiatric disease, patients with low socioeconomic status, and those who were unemployed104. Among patients with breast cancer, decreased libido, poor self-image, and relationship issues were common among those who were depressed105-107.
Treatment for depression and anxiety in cancer patients and survivors with medication and psychotherapy is comprehensively described in the recent ASCO anxiety and depression guideline adaptation (http://www.instituteforquality.org/screening-assessment-and-care-anxietyand-depressive-symptoms-adults-cancer-american-society) 15. In addition, or instead of pharmacotherapy, mindfulness-based approaches, expression of positive emotions, spiritual interventions, hope therapy, and meaning-making interventions have shown promise in addressing psychosocial needs of breast cancer survivors108. While the methodology studying the effectiveness of these interventions varied, survivors experienced positive changes, such as enhanced quality of life and well-being108. If a patient has a clinically significant score on any of the previously discussed instruments, it is recommended that primary care clinicians refer patients to the appropriate psychosocial oncology specialists, mental health professionals and/or resources in the community27. After referring to the appropriate resource(s), primary care clinicians should follow-up with patients to check their adherence to recommended therapies and/or assess the need for additional referrals. If a patient has difficulties with adherence to recommendations, primary care clinicians should identify the challenges with adherence and help the patient overcome these obstacles before discussing alternative interventions 15. The American Psychosocial Oncology Society website (http://www.apos-society.org/) can help primary care clinicians identify resources for their patients.

Fatigue Where appropriate, these recommendations build upon the recently published ASCO
screening, assessment and treatment of cancer-related fatigue guidelines among adult cancer survivors 25. Recommendation 4.6: It is recommended that primary care clinicians (a) Should assess for fatigue and treat any causative factors for fatigue, including anemia, thyroid dysfunction, and cardiac dysfunction (LOE= 0); (b) Should offer treatment or referral for factors that may impact fatigue (e.g. mood disorders, sleep disturbance, pain, etc.) for those who do not have an otherwise identifiable cause of fatigue (LOE= I); (c) Should counsel patients to engage in regular physical activity and refer for cognitive behavioral therapy as appropriate (LOE= I). Clinical interpretation: Cancer-related fatigue is very common among those treated for cancer, especially those who undergo treatment with radiation therapy and chemotherapy 13, 25, 109, with an estimated prevalence of 28% - 91% 110, 111. Recommendations for how to screen and assess for fatigue can be found in the online Appendix and come from ASCO’s guideline 25. For some, fatigue lasts long after treatment and can significantly interfere with QoL. Treatable causes of fatigue include anemia, thyroid dysfunction, and cardiac dysfunction 25. For those who do not have an identifiable physical cause of fatigue (i.e., anemia), contributing factors, such as mood disorders, sleep disturbance, and pain, should be addressed 25. Additional information related to distress/depression and pain can be found under Recommendation 4.5.
A regular exercise regimen can reduce fatigue, help survivors feel better physically and emotionally and help them cope as has been demonstrated by several RCTs in breast cancer survivors 23, 25, 112 (see also Recommendation 5.3). Cognitive behavioral therapy may also lessen fatigue113, 114. There are minimal data to support use of pharmacologic agents for management of fatigue in this population 25. Interventions should be tailored to the needs and abilities of the individual breast cancer survivor. ASCO has more detailed information on the

management of fatigue for cancer survivors (http://www.instituteforquality.org/screeningassessment-and-management-fatigue-adult-survivors-cancer-american-society-clinical)25.
Bone Health Recommendation 4.7: It is recommended that primary care clinicians (a) Should refer post-menopausal breast cancer survivors for a baseline DEXA scan (LOE=0); (b) Should refer for repeat DEXA scans every 2 years for women taking an aromatase inhibitor, premenopausal women taking tamoxifen and/or a GnRH agonist, and women who have chemo-induced premature menopause (LOE=0). Clinical interpretation: The rate and magnitude of bone loss caused by cancer therapy is significantly higher than normal age-related bone loss115, 116. Up to 80% of breast cancer patients experience bone loss117, 118. Osteoporosis risk factors unique to patients following cancer therapy include chemotherapy-induced premature menopause, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) suppression of gonadal function, antiestrogen therapies and glucocorticoids119. These risk factors are cumulative with other known risk factors, including age, prior fracture history and family history of fracture120, 121. Lifestyle-related factors, including smoking, excess alcohol, inadequate exercise, low calcium and vitamin D deficiency are common in this population and increase the risk of osteoporosis119. The primary care clinician should manage symptoms as he or she would in the general population.
Post-menopausal women treated with aromatase inhibitors are at increased risk of osteoporosis and should have initial and periodic (every 2 years) DEXA scan screening. If major risk factors change, a repeat DEXA scan at one year is reasonable to consider119. All postmenopausal women or premenopausal women receiving ovarian suppression therapy with GnRH agonists are at risk for developing osteoporosis and should be screened according to the US Preventive Services Task Force31 and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists guide for postmenopausal osteoporosis diagnosis and treatment32.

Initial strategies to reduce the morbidity associated with bone loss include education about risk factors and a healthy lifestyle. These should include physical activity and regular weight-bearing exercise, avoiding tobacco use, limiting alcohol intake, and consider supplementation with calcium (to achieve a total intake of 1200mg/d) and Vitamin D3 (800-1000 IU/day) for all adults > age 50 years119, 122-127. In addition to lifestyle and nutritional interventions, pharmacologic options should be considered in patients at high risk for bone loss and/or fracture119. Bisphosphonates or denosumab can prevent bone loss and/or treat established osteoporosis119, 128-130. However, these drugs do have side effects and risks so that the risk vs. benefit of antiresorptive therapy must be carefully considered before starting therapy. Estrogen receptor modulators (raloxifene and tamoxifen) also have antiresorptive properties. However, in one large trial, combining a SERM and aromatase inhibitor blunted the reduction in breast cancer recurrence compared to AI alone. Therefore, SERM’s should not be used for the prevention of osteoporosis in women taking an aromatase inhibitor131.
Musculoskeletal Health Recommendation 4.8: It is recommended that primary care clinicians (a) Should assess for musculoskeletal symptoms, including pain, by asking patients about their symptoms at each clinical encounter (LOE=0); (b) Should offer one or more of the following interventions based on clinical indication: acupuncture, physical activity, referral for physical therapy or rehabilitation (LOE=III). Clinical interpretation: Breast cancer survivors may report difficulties with the ipsilateral upper extremity following surgery, including decreased range of motion, rotator cuff injury, adhesive capsulitis (“frozen shoulder” with stiffness and pain in the shoulder joint), and axillary web syndrome (“cording” in the skin of the inner arm with sensations of pain and tightness that appear as a web or corded rope)132, 133. These abnormalities can lead to a decreased ability to perform activities of daily living and can impact employment. Systemic therapies for breast

cancer have also been associated with the development of musculoskeletal symptoms134. The prevalence of musculoskeletal symptoms among breast cancer patients varies greatly: shoulder range of motion (1.5-50%), musculoskeletal pain (12-51%), upper limb weakness (18-23%), and numbness (29-81%)132, 135-137. In particular, up to 50% of postmenopausal women receiving treatment with aromatase inhibitor medications report arthralgias (joint pain) and myalgias (muscle pain) which are severe enough in 20% of women to lead to treatment discontinuation138, 139. These aromatase inhibitor associated musculoskeletal symptoms are often not responsive to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and acetaminophen. Another option for treatment is to change from one anti-estrogen therapy to another. About 40% who discontinue the drug may tolerate a different AI or different formulation of the AI. The rest generally tolerate tamoxifen140. Poor compliance adherence to therapy has been shown to result in an increased risk of breast cancer recurrence, so helping patients manage their symptoms and encouraging drug compliance is important141.
Physical therapy, including stretching and other exercises, has been shown to be effective for managing post-surgical musculoskeletal symptoms142, 143. Recent data from the Hormones and Physical Exercise trial, a prospective cohort study, demonstrated that participation in an intensive exercise regimen resulted in a 20% decrease in aromatase inhibitorassociated pain144. To date, only acupuncture107 and exercise145 have been demonstrated to result in a statistically significant improvement in aromatase inhibitor-associated symptoms145, 146.
Pain and Neuropathy Recommendation 4.9: It is recommended that primary care clinicians (a) Should assess for pain and contributing factors for pain with the use of a simple pain scale and comprehensive history of the patient’s complaint (LOE=0). (b) Should offer interventions, such as acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, physical activity and/or

acupuncture, for pain (LOE=I); (c) Should refer to an appropriate specialist depending on the etiology of the pain once the underlying etiology has been determined (e.g., lymphedema specialist, occupational therapist, etc.) (LOE=0); (d) Should assess for peripheral neuropathy and contributing factors for peripheral neuropathy by asking the patient about their symptoms, specifically numbness and tingling in their hands and/or feet, and the characteristics of that symptom (LOE=0); (e) Should offer physical activity for neuropathy (LOE=IA); (f) Should offer duloxetine for patients with neuropathic pain, numbness and tingling (LOE=IB). Clinical interpretation: A substantial percentage of breast cancer survivors experience long-term treatment-related chronic pain that can negatively impact QoL. Published reports demonstrate that 25-60% of breast cancer survivors experience chronic pain as a result of the treatments administered, including surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and endocrine therapy139, 147150.
Patients should also be evaluated for secondary causes of pain, such as lymphedema or tightness of the chest wall or axilla, and referred to lymphedema specialists or occupational therapists as indicated. Once the work-up and assessment are complete and underlying causes identified or ruled out, chronic pain following breast cancer surgery is typically treated with standard analgesics, including acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.
Acupuncture and physical activity have been shown in meta-analyses of RCTs to improve pain among breast cancer survivors and are typically used to complement traditional cancer care. Treatment-related joint pain among breast cancer survivors is quite commonly treated with acupuncture, with many trials and systematic reviews demonstrating its efficacy in decreasing pain intensity146, 151. However, evidence is lacking to show that acupuncture directly benefits breast cancer survivors who are experiencing cancer-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN). Physical activity has been shown in multiple RCTs to improve pain152 .

Neuropathy, including numbness, tingling, and burning pain, is also common following a diagnosis of breast cancer and subsequent treatment. It is particularly common following surgery and after treatment with taxane- or platinum-based chemotherapy regimens, reported in 30-40% of patients149. ASCO recently published a Clinical Practice Guideline about the prevention and management of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN; http://www.instituteforquality.org/prevention-and-management-chemotherapy-inducedperipheral-neuropathy-survivors-adult-cancers)14 and we endorse this guideline.
Prevention and treatment approaches for the management of CIPN in adult cancer survivors, reproduced from the ASCO guideline, are available in the online Appendix. In a few small RCTs with breast cancer survivors, physical activity has been shown to improve arthralgias, neuropathy, and neuropathy symptoms145, 153. A number of pharmaceutical agents have been tested for management of CIPN. The serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), duloxetine, was shown in a randomized placebo-controlled trial to decrease neuropathic pain significantly more than placebo, and may also improve numbness and tingling. The trial used an initial dose of 30 mg daily for the first week to reduce the likelihood of nausea, which was then increased to 60 mg daily. Associated relative risk benefit was 30-50% in pain reduction154. Studies of tricyclic antidepressants and anticonvulsants have not demonstrated consistent significant improvements in symptoms. Additional recommendations for the prevention and management of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy can be found in the recently published ASCO guidelines14.
Infertility Recommendation 4.10: It is recommended that primary care clinicians should refer survivors of childbearing age who experience infertility to a specialist in reproductive endocrinology and infertility as soon as possible (LOE=0).

Clinical interpretation: Infertility, as a result of cancer treatment, is a potential long-term side effect faced by younger breast cancer survivors (younger than age 45). When it occurs, it can have profound impact on a survivor’s physical, psychosocial, and QoL48. Breast cancer cases among patients between the ages of 20 and 45 represent 10.9% of all new breast cancer cases in the United States2 making infertility an issue for many younger survivors155.
Chemotherapy can be gonadotoxic leading to reduced fertility or early menopause secondary to premature ovarian failure77, 155. Many of the most frequently used chemotherapy agents in the treatment of breast cancer (e.g., alkylating agents, platinum agents, and taxanes) are also those that most often lead to premature ovarian failure156. The incidence of chemotherapy-related amenorrhea increases with age, as the female ovarian reserve is nonrenewable and diminishes steadily with age. However, there is considerable variation in ovarian reserve in women of similar age157. There is limited literature related to the gonadotoxicity of biologics and targeted therapies and more studies are needed. Primary care clinicians should involve the treating medical oncologist in any potential discussion related to the optimal time for pregnancy after the completion of breast cancer treatment. Pre-menopausal women who desire pregnancy and are having difficulty conceiving for 6 months or more (or have had more than one miscarriage) should be referred to a fertility specialist. Timely referral is crucial due to the rapid loss of ovarian reserve in these women.
Sexual Health Recommendation 4.11: It is recommended that primary care clinicians (a) Should assess for signs and symptoms of sexual dysfunction or problems with sexual intimacy (LOE=0); (b) Should assess for reversible contributing factors to sexual dysfunction and treat, when appropriate (LOE=0); (c) Should offer nonhormonal, water-based lubricants and moisturizers for vaginal dryness (LOE=IA); (d) Should refer for psychoeducational

support, group therapy, sexual counseling, marital counseling or intensive psychotherapy, when appropriate (LOE=IA). Clinical interpretation: Sexual complaints are a common problem among breast cancer survivors that should be assessed. They can include sexual desire disorder / decreased libido (23–64%), arousal or lubrication concerns (20-48%), orgasmic concerns (16-36%), and dyspareunia (3538%)77. Patients who were treated with chemotherapy tend to have more of these sexual concerns than those treated only with surgery and/or radiation50. Treatment with aromatase inhibitors may cause vaginal dryness, dyspareunia (which can be severe), menopausal symptoms, and loss of sexual desire158. Radiation therapy can often cause skin fibrosis, loss of sexual sensitivity of the skin, and uncommonly cardiac and respiratory damage, all of which negatively impact sexual desire and response159.
It is important to counsel patients concerning possible sexual dysfunction remedies including treatments for vaginal dryness. Nonhormonal, water-based lubricants and moisturizers remain the primary treatment160. Silicone-based products may last longer than water or glycerin-based products. A combination of therapies may provide additional short-term comfort. Hormonal therapies, such as a low dose estrogen vaginal tablet or estradiol vaginal ring, may be recommended for vaginal dryness due to urogenital atrophy, although results commonly take approximately 6-12 weeks160, 161. The safety of these therapies in women with a history of breast cancer is not well established at this time. The level of estrogen absorption is variable, which raises concerns in patients with a history of breast cancer. Use of hormonal therapies for women on aromatase inhibitors is not recommended162. Treating dyspareunia secondary to vaginal atrophy and stenosis with vaginal dilators or pelvic floor relaxation techniques may be helpful77.
Referral for interventions, such as brief psychoeducational support, group therapy, sexual counseling, marital counseling or intensive psychotherapy should be offered to all breast cancer survivors with sexual complaints specifically addressing possible anxiety, stress,

unpleasant symptoms including hot flashes, sexual comfort in lovemaking, and mood changes50, 158, 163. Taken together, the trio of counseling, over-the-counter treatments, and pharmacologic treatments can do much to ameliorate the sexual issues caused by breast cancer and its management158. See Recommendation 4.1 to address body image concerns.
Premature Menopause/Hot Flashes Recommendation 4.12: It is recommended that primary care clinicians should offer selective serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), gabapentin, lifestyle modifications and/or environmental modifications to help mitigate vasomotor symptoms of premature menopausal symptoms (LOE=IA). Clinical interpretation: Women can experience menopausal symptoms if chemotherapy results in premature cessation of ovarian function or as a side effect of endocrine therapies. Vasomotor symptoms are typically more severe in younger survivors due to the abrupt change in hormones164 and when present, can have significant impact on QoL. For younger women on endocrine therapies, 50-70% will likely experience hot flashes while on tamoxifen77.
Systemic hormone therapy is rarely, if ever, given to patients with breast cancer to control menopausal symptoms. Non-hormonal medications such as serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) can decrease the intensity and severity of vasomotor symptoms, although are not FDA approved for this indication. The SNRI, venlafaxine, has been found to be safe and effective at reducing hot flashes165. There is concern that SSRIs that inhibit the CYP2D6 enzyme pathway, such as paroxetine, may reduce the conversion of tamoxifen to active metabolites, although a negative impact on breast cancer outcomes has not been conclusively demonstrated166. Consistent with recommendations by ASCO and NCCN, patients should not be screened for CYP2D6 9, 167. The anticonvulsant gabapentin has also been shown to be effective in reducing hot flashes168-170.

Similarly, the antihypertensive, clonidine, has been used in clinical practice171. Antihypertensive medications, lifestyle and environmental modifications may also help decrease the intensity and severity of menopausal symptoms. Acupuncture has been shown, in a meta-analysis of RCTs with breast cancer survivors, to reduce menopausal symptoms and hot flashes172. Lifestyle interventions, including rhythmic breathing, vitamins, exercise, and avoiding spicy foods caffeine, and alcohol, have had variable results. Environmental modifications such as cool rooms and dressing in layers can also be helpful. Complementary therapies have been studied and some have been found to be minimally effective 173.
HEALTH PROMOTION Women with breast cancer are likely to have long-term survival1. Thus enhancing length
and quality of life is an important goal in the care of patients with breast cancer and in creating a survivorship care plan (see Recommendations 5.1 and 6.1 for more information on Survivorship Care Plans). Healthy behaviors are paramount to reducing the risk of second cancers, comorbidities, obesity, and possibly recurrence; improving prognosis; ameliorating cancerrelated symptoms174-179; and decreasing risk of mortality176-186.
Table 5 outlines this information, including physical activity, nutrition, and smoking cessation recommendations for breast cancer survivorship, incorporating existing ACS Nutrition and Physical Activity recommendations 23. (Table 5: Health Promotion Guidelines)
Information Recommendation 5.1: It is recommended that primary care clinicians (a) Should assess the information needs of the patient related to breast cancer and its treatment, side effects, other health concerns, and available support services (LOE=0); (b) Should provide or refer survivors to appropriate resources to meet these needs (LOE=0).

Clinical interpretation: Breast cancer survivors often express unmet needs for information after treatment, including information on the effects of cancer treatment, emotional distress, and lifestyle changes187, 188. Younger breast cancer patients can be particularly vulnerable to the physical, emotional, and psychosocial late effects of treatment due to the aggressiveness of their disease, intensity of treatment plan48, 189, and based on younger age when a cancer diagnosis is not as common or expected 190, 191. Treatment summaries and individualized survivorship care plans provide survivors with individualized information on their cancer care. However, to date, there exists inconsistency in their implementation, comprehensiveness, and perceived helpfulness for both patients and primary care clinicians63, 192-194.
Results from randomized trials of survivorship care plans are mixed195-198 making the direct benefits of survivorship care plans less clear. However, failure of specialists to provide treatment summaries and survivorship care plans to primary care clinicians is an obstacle to primary care clinicians providing relevant information and care to their patients with a history of breast cancer.
The informational needs of breast cancer survivors and caregivers should be routinely assessed and information about the long-term and late effects of breast cancer treatment, as well as information on risk reduction and health promotion, should be provided. Resources that may be beneficial to share with patients include the ACS Survivorship Center website (www.cancer.org/survivorshipcenter)62, the ACS website199, Journey Forward (www.journeyforward.org), the American Society of Clinical Oncology’s (ASCO) survivor and caregiver site (www.cancer.net), and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) patient and caregiver resources (http://www.nccn.org/patients/default.aspx).
Obesity Recommendation 5.2: It is recommended that primary care clinicians (a) Should counsel survivors to achieve and maintain a healthy weight (LOE=III); (b) Should counsel

survivors if overweight or obese to limit consumption of high-calorie foods and beverages and increase physical activity to promote and maintain weight loss (LOE=IA, III). Clinical interpretation: Approximately 62% of breast cancer survivors are overweight/obese (have a BMI of least 25kg/m2), of which 30% are classified as obese (BMI 30kg/m2 or higher)200. Sufficient evidence documents obesity as a risk factor for post-operative complications, second cancers, risk of recurrence, development of diabetes, and other issues. Conversely, weight loss mitigates symptoms and improves quality of life 201. ASCO issued a position statement underscoring the need for oncology providers to counsel their patients about achieving a healthy weight 202. Primary care clinicians should also counsel cancer survivors to achieve or maintain a healthy weight201 and refer to multi-component obesity treatment programs where appropriate 203.
Physical Activity Recommendation 5.3: It is recommended that primary care clinicians should counsel survivors to engage in regular physical activity consistent with the ACS guideline23 and specifically: (a) Should avoid inactivity and return to normal daily activities as soon as possible following diagnosis (LOE=III); (b) Should aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate or 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic exercise per week (LOE=I, IA); (c) Should include strength training exercises at least 2 days per week. Emphasize strength training for women treated with adjuvant chemotherapy or hormone therapy (LOE= IA). Clinical interpretation: Approximately 32% of cancer survivors meet the recommendations for physical activity204. Numerous systematic reviews and meta-analyses document the many health benefits from physical activity in breast cancer survivors, including mitigating treatment side-effects (i.e., fatigue) and improving quality of life and physical functioning. The data suggesting a potential survival benefit of physical activity come from observational data with the

most recent review of this literature citing 16 studies reporting an average relative risk of 0.72 for breast cancer deaths in physically active breast cancer survivors (95% CI: .60-.85) and 0.52 for all-cause mortality (95% CI: .42-.64) 205. Breast cancer survivors should be advised to return to normal daily activities as soon as possible following diagnosis and continue to engage in regular physical activity. Breast cancer survivors should strive to exercise at least 150 minutes moderately or 75 minutes vigorously per week and include strength training exercises at least 2 days per week23. Additional details regarding the amount of time needed for each strength training session is less clear. However, studies indicate that 37-53% of breast cancer survivors meet the aerobic guideline206, 207 and 23% meet the strength training guideline208. Observational evidence suggests greater amounts of activity may be needed although the evidence is insufficient to make this a recommendation at this time; aerobic exercise of 3 hours or more per week may be needed to improve breast cancer survival186, 209.
Nutrition Recommendation 5.4: It is recommended that primary care clinicians should counsel survivors to achieve a dietary pattern that is high in vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and legumes, low in saturated fats (LOE= IA, III), and limited in alcohol consumption (LOE=0). Clinical interpretation: Only 18-34% of breast cancer survivors report eating 5 or more fruit and vegetables a day207. Eating a diet characterized by high amounts of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and legumes (vs. a typical Western diet) has been associated with reduced risk (1543%) for all-cause mortality210-212. Data from the two large RCTs of diet interventions in breast cancer survivors suggest that dietary change sufficient to result in weight loss may be needed to favorably impact breast cancer recurrence and prognosis 213, 214. Per ACS Nutrition and Physical Activity Guidelines, alcohol consumption should be limited to no more than one drink per day for women, as in the general population215, 216. Data are inconsistent but suggest that
41

breast cancer survivors who consume more than 3 to 4 drinks per week are at increased risk for breast cancer recurrence217.
Studies have shown that the carcinogenic ingredients of alcohol increase the risk of developing many types of cancers218-220 when alcohol, regardless of the type of (i.e., wine, beer, etc), is consumed in excess of daily recommended limits221. Approximately 7% of breast cancer survivors report excessive drinking206. Based on these data, survivors should be counseled to: achieve a dietary pattern that is high in vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and legumes; limit alcohol intake to no more than one drink per day; and follow the ACS Guidelines on Nutrition and Physical Activity for Cancer Survivors 23 with a focus on successful weight management.
Smoking Cessation Recommendation 5.5: It is recommended that primary care clinicians should counsel survivors to avoid smoking and refer survivors who smoke to cessation counseling and resources (LOE= I). Clinical interpretation: Approximately 10-12% of breast cancer survivors smoke206, 207. Numerous observational studies show that women who smoke at the time of diagnosis have substantially worse breast cancer-specific and overall survival than former and never smokers222. A recent meta-analysis of this observational work documents a 33% increased risk of mortality from breast cancer in women who are smokers at diagnosis compared to former smokers 222. Survivors should discontinue smoking and avoid subsequent tobacco product use. Clinicians should identify smokers and motivate and encourage patients to quit through cessation programs, brochures and pamphlets, counseling, pharmacotherapy and regular follow-up223. These programs should be initiated at the time of initial diagnosis if possible.
CARE COORDINATION / PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS (Table 6: Care Coordination Guideline)
42

Accepted Article

There are no clear guidelines for the shared care and co-management of patients with breast cancer after the completion of active treatment. The time to transition is variable and dependent on medical, geographic, and resource restraints. Some patients return to their primary care clinician immediately after treatment is completed224-226. Others may choose to transition to their follow-up care only after they are considered at little or low risk for disease recurrence or late effects of cancer treatment227, 228. Several RCTs show that care led by primary care clinicians is as effective as hospital- or specialist-led care, including similar rates of recurrence-related serious clinical events, levels of health-related QoL229 , and patient satisfaction with care230 .
Breast cancer survivors may continue to see their oncology team for follow-up disease surveillance; however, they should also be seen by their primary care clinician for health maintenance and management of co-morbidities that may or may not be related to their cancer diagnosis and treatment225, 231.
Survivorship Care Plan Recommendation 6.1: It is recommended that primary care clinicians should consult with the cancer treatment team and obtain a treatment summary and Survivorship Care Plan (LOE=0, III). Clinical interpretation: Survivorship care plans are recommended as an important tool to facilitate communication and allocation of responsibility during the transition from active treatment to survivorship care 4, 232. A summary of a patient’s diagnosis and treatment received should be provided by the oncology care team when a patient with breast cancer transitions care to other providers; a treatment summary should describe the type and stage/side of the cancer, type of surgery, the name of the chemotherapy/hormones/biologics and cumulative doses of chemotherapy and the types and cumulative doses of radiation therapy, including the

fields and extent of the radiation 4, 192 . Patients can initiate the building of a survivorship care plan process on ASCO’s website: http://www.cancer.net/survivorship/follow-care-after-cancertreatment/asco-cancer-treatment-and-survivorship-care-plans, at http://www.journeyforward.org/ or at http://www.livestrongcareplan.org/.
Ideally, the oncology team should also work with the patient to develop an individualized cancer survivorship care plan for breast cancer survivors. This care plan guides recommendations for the type and timing of follow up imaging, laboratory tests, and office visits. The care plan should include information on the risk for late effects of treatment and what to watch for specifically based on the type of cancer and treatment received. Survivors should be assessed for the presence of these physical (e.g., cardiovascular issues, musculoskeletal issues), as well as psychosocial effects (e.g., cognitive dysfunction, depression, fear of recurrence, body image and sexual dysfunction) and be referred to the appropriate providers and services.
The field of oncology is, however, broadly struggling with how to best meet this recommendation, and in identifying the specific benefits of such care plans. Various tools and strategies to facilitate the creation and distribution of these care plans are being actively considered, for all tumor sites, including breast cancer. Challenges in workflow and tools make this difficult currently but the field is working toward a sustainable solution.
Communication with Oncology Team Recommendation 6.2: It is recommended that primary care clinicians should maintain communication with the oncology team throughout your patient’s diagnosis, treatment and post-treatment care to ensure care is evidence-based and well-coordinated (LOE=0). Clinical interpretation: Communication and cooperation among providers and survivors is critical, with the oncology team providing concrete recommendations for care when needed or
44

Page 45 of 87

CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians

Accepted Article

requested by other providers232. Clear communication regarding the respective roles of different members of the health-care team is critical to a successful transition to survivorship care.
The primary care clinician should serve as a general medical care coordinator throughout the spectrum of breast cancer detection and aftercare, focusing on evidence-based preventive care and the management of preexisting comorbid conditions, regularly addressing the patient’s overall physical and psychosocial status, making appropriate referrals for psychosocial, rehabilitative, or other specialist care as needed, and coordinating those components of survivorship care that are agreed upon with the treating clinicians. Treatment of breast cancer is complex and rapidly changing; therefore, decisions about and coordination of cancer treatment should be left to the oncology team.
Inclusion of Family Recommendation 6.3: It is recommended that primary care clinicians should encourage the inclusion of caregivers, spouses, or partners in usual breast cancer survivorship care and support (LOE=0). Clinical interpretation: Caregivers have to cope with the physical aftermath of the survivors’ treatment and manage their long-term and late effects, in addition to their own psychosocial and physical unmet needs233. Research has shown that for 14-24 months after a survivor’s cancer diagnosis, caregivers provide consistent, continuing care involvement234 for patients following breast cancer treatment. Successful coordination of care involves not only a comprehensive care team, including primary care clinicians, but also the informal caregivers (usually the spouse/partner/family member) who provide ongoing care to cancer survivors in the home235. Furthermore most caregivers are older adults who are also managing their own health problems. When possible, primary care clinicians should include caregivers of breast cancer survivors in all follow-up care appointments to optimize survivor wellness.

DISCUSSION A significant limitation of this guideline is the limited evidence-base to provide clear and
specific recommendations for the prevention and management of long-term and late effects of cancer survivors. There are few prospective, randomized controlled trials testing interventions among breast cancer survivors even though studies in breast cancer survivors dominate the survivorship literature. The majority of the citations characterizing the risk and magnitude of risk of late effects and management recommendations rely predominantly on case-control studies with fewer than 500 participants and reviews that combine studies with varying outcome measures. There were several cohort studies that used population-based data to estimate the risk of late effects.
Another limitation is the reliance on previous guidelines for surveillance and symptom management. Additionally, the literature review was not managed by a clinical epidemiologist due to limited resources; and instead was conducted by project staff and an ACS librarian. Furthermore, the guidelines did not result directly from the development of specific clinical questions asked prior to the literature review; and guidelines included in the literature review were not evaluated through an instrument such as the Rigor of Development subscale of the Appraisal for Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE II). Recommendations are based on current evidence in the literature, but most evidence is not sufficient to warrant a strong recommendation. Rather, recommendations should be largely seen as possible management strategies given the current limited evidence base. HEALTH DISPARITIES
Although the ACS/ASCO clinical practice guidelines represent expert recommendations on the best practices in disease management to provide the highest level of cancer care, it is important to note that many patients have limited access to medical care. Racial and ethnic disparities in health care contribute significantly to this problem in the United States. Patients with cancer who are members of racial/ethnic minorities suffer disproportionately from
46

comorbidities, experience more substantial obstacles to receiving care, are more likely to be uninsured, and are at greater risk of receiving care of poor quality than other Americans 236-239. Many other patients lack access to care because of their geographic location and distance from appropriate treatment facilities. Awareness of these disparities in access to care should be considered in the context of this clinical practice guideline, and health care providers should strive to deliver the highest level of cancer care to these vulnerable populations.
ACS and ASCO believe that cancer clinical trials are vital to inform medical decisions and improve cancer care, and that all patients should have the opportunity to participate.

MULTIPLE CHRONIC CONDITIONS Creating evidence-based recommendations to inform treatment of patients with
additional chronic conditions, a situation in which the patient may have two or more such conditions—referred to as multiple chronic conditions (MCC)—is challenging 240. Patients with MCC are a complex and heterogeneous population, making it difficult to account for all of the possible permutations to develop specific recommendations for care. In addition, the best available evidence for treating index conditions, such as cancer, is often from clinical trials whose study selection criteria may exclude these patients in order to avoid potential interaction effects or confounding of results associated with MCC. As a result, the reliability of outcome data from these studies may be limited, thereby creating constraints for expert groups to make recommendations for care in this heterogeneous patient population.
As many patients for whom guideline recommendations apply present with MCC, any treatment plan needs to take into account the complexity and uncertainty created by the presence of MCC and highlights the importance of shared decision making regarding guideline use and implementation. Therefore, in consideration of recommended care for the target index
47

Accepted Article

condition, clinicians should review all other chronic conditions present in the patient and take those conditions into account when formulating the treatment and follow-up plan. In light of the above considerations, practice guidelines should provide information on how to apply the recommendations for patients with MCC, perhaps as a qualifying statement for recommended care. This may mean that some or all of the recommended care options are modified or not applied, as determined by best practice in consideration of any MCC.
EXTERNAL REVIEW After finalization by the workgroup, the guideline manuscript was sent to additional internal (ACS and ASCO) and external experts for review and comment prior to submission for publication. Review comments were reviewed by the Expert Panel and integrated into the final manuscript before approval by the CPGC.
GUIDELINE IMPLEMENTATION ACS/ASCO guidelines are developed for implementation across health settings. Barriers to implementation include the need to increase awareness of the guideline recommendations among front-line practitioners and survivors of cancer and caregivers, and also to provide adequate services in the face of limited resources. The guideline Bottom Line Box was designed to facilitate implementation of recommendations. This guideline will be distributed widely through the ASCO Practice Guideline Implementation Network. ACS/ASCO guidelines are posted on the ACS Website and ASCO Website. This joint ACS-ASCO guideline is also published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology.
SUMMARY Breast cancer survivors face potentially significant impacts of cancer and its treatment
and deserve high-quality, comprehensive, coordinated clinical follow-up care. Primary care 48

clinicians must consider each patient’s individual risk profile and preferences of care to address physical and psychosocial impacts. Survivors should be provided support to address fear of recurrence, depression, anxiety, cognitive impairment, body image issues, sexual concerns, functional changes and physical impairments, relationship changes, other social role difficulties, employment concerns, and financial challenges, among others. Breast cancer survivors also need to be counseled on health promotion strategies to minimize and mitigate long-term and late effects, ameliorate comorbid health conditions and to potentially increase survival.
To clarify the roles of all clinicians working with cancer survivors, we concur with the IOM that survivors and primary care clinicians receive a survivorship care plan, which includes a concise summary of treatment as well as a clinical follow-up care plan. Ideally, this plan would be constructed in partnership with the survivor to identify and prioritize goals for survivorship care and would be communicated to the patient to ensure understanding of individual risks; recommended tests, procedures and supportive care strategies; and how to optimize wellness. Survivorship care should be coordinated with treating cancer specialists.
ADDITIONAL RESOURCES In addition to this guideline, tools and resources are available to assist primary care
clinicians in implementing these recommendations. The CA Journal offers the CA Patient Page (publisher insert URL) to help patients understand how to use this guideline to talk to their doctor about surveillance and screening, symptom management, healthy behaviors and care coordination. The Survivorship Center also offers The GW Cancer Institute’s Cancer Survivorship E-Learning Series for Primary Care Providers (The E-Learning Series), a free, innovative online continuing education program to educate primary care clinicians about how to better understand and care for survivors in the primary care setting. Continuing education credits are available at no cost to physicians, nurse practitioners, nurses and physician assistants for each 1-hour module. Learn more about The E-learning Series at

Intervention Options (high intensity)  Psychological (individual: CBT, Interpersonal Therapy)  Pharmacologic  Combined

Psychological (individual)  Delivered by licensed mental health professionals using relevant treatment manuals which may include some or all of the following content: cognitive change, behavioral activation, biobehavioral strategies, education, and/or relaxation strategies.  Relapse prevention additions are also important.  Monitor for efficacy.  Behavioral couples’ therapy can be considered for people with a regular partner and where the relationship may contribute to the development or maintenance of depression.
Pharmacological  Anti-depressants, with choice informed by side effect profiles, interactions, response, patient age and preference.  Consider interventions with short term duration.  Monitor regularly for adherence, side effects, and adverse events.
Psychosocial (group)  Structured, professionally led, with topics such as: stress reduction, positive coping (seeking information, problem
solving, assertive communication), enhancing social support from friends/family, coping with physical symptoms (e.g., fatigue, sexual dysfunction) and bodily changes, and health behavior change (diet, activity level, tobacco use).  Consider for individual treatment should depressive symptoms not remit or worsen.

Supportive Care Services for All Patients, As Available and Appropriate
Provide education and information (verbal plus any relevant materials) for the patient and family about:  Normalcy of stress in the context of cancer  Specific stress reduction strategies (e.g., progressive muscle relaxation)  Sources of informational support/resources (patient library, reliable internet sites)  Availability of supportive care services (e.g., professionally led groups, informational lectures, volunteer organizations) for the patient and family at the institution or in the community  Availability of financial support (e.g., accommodations, transportation, health/drug benefits)  Information about signs and symptoms of depression if stress or distress worsen and avenues for care  Information on sleep hygiene and self-management of fatigue  Information on other non-pharmacological interventions (physical activity, nutrition)
Follow-up and ongoing re-assessment
It is common for persons with depressive symptoms to lack the motivation necessary to follow through on referrals and/or to comply with treatment recommendations. With this in mind, on a bi-weekly or monthly basis, until symptoms have remitted:  Assess follow-through and compliance with individual or group psychological/psychosocial referrals, as well as satisfaction with these services.  Assess compliance with pharmacologic treatment, patient’s concerns about side effects, and satisfaction with the symptom relief..  If compliance is poor, assess and construct a plan to circumvent obstacles to compliance, or discuss alternative interventions that present fewer obstacles.  After 8 weeks of treatment, if symptom reduction and satisfaction with treatment are poor, despite good compliance, alter the treatment course (e.g., add a
psychological or pharmacological intervention; change the specific medication; refer to individual psychotherapy if group therapy has not proved helpful).

Screening and Assessment – Fatigue in Cancer Survivors Routinely screen for fatigue

Page 82 of 87

Use a numeric rating scale as clinically indicated and at least annually.

Education and Counseling
• All patients should be offered specific education about fatigue following treatment (e.g. information about the difference between normal and cancer related fatigue, persistence of fatigue post treatment, and causes and contributing factors).All patients should be offered advice on general strategies that help manage fatigue (e.g., maintaining physical activity) and guidance on self-monitoring of fatigue levels.

Comprehensive and Focused Assessment
(for patients who report moderate to severe fatigue)
History and Physical 1) Perform a focused fatigue history, including:
• Onset, pattern, duration • Change over time • Associated or alleviating factors
2) Evaluate disease status by: • Evaluate risk of recurrence based on stage, pathologic factors, and treatment history • Perform review of systems to determine if other symptoms substantiate suspicion for recurrence
3) Assess treatable contributing factors: • Comorbidities (e.g, cardiac dysfunction, endocrine dysfunction, pulmonary dysfunction, renal dysfunction, anemia, arthritis, neuromuscular complications, sleep disturbances, pain, emotional distress) • Medications (consider persistent use of sleep aids, pain medications, or antiemetics) • Alcohol/substance abuse • Nutritional Issues • Weight/caloric intake changes • Deconditioning
As a shared responsibility, the clinical team must decide when referral to an appropriately trained professional (e.g., cardiologist, endocrinologist, mental health professional, internist, etc.) is needed.
Laboratory Evaluation • Consider performing laboratory evaluation based on presence of other symptoms, onset, and severity of fatigue • CBC with differential
o Compare end-of-treatment hemoglobin/hematocrit with current values o Assess other cell lines (WBC and platelets) • Comprehensive metabolic panel o Assess electrolytes o Assess hepatic and renal function • Endocrinologic evaluation o TSH o Consider more comprehensive evaluation or referral to specialist if other symptoms present

Treatment and Care Map – Fatigue in Cancer Survivors

Treat Contributing Factors
Address all medical and substance-induced treatable contributing factors first (e.g., pain, depression, anxiety, emotional distress, sleep disturbance, nutrition deficit, activity level, anemia, medication side-effects, and comorbidities). See Table 2 for more details.

Interventions for Cancer-Related Fatigue
Some patients may also benefit from interventions described below to treat fatigue. Currently, there are no clear standards to select among these for an individual patient. Further research is needed to establish a strategy for prioritizing, sequencing, and linking the available options. If treated for fatigue, patients should be followed and re-evaluated on a regular basis to determine whether treatment is effective or needs to be reassessed.

Physical Activity
• Initiating/maintaining adequate levels of physical activity can reduce cancer-related fatigue in post-treatment survivors. • Actively encourage all patients to engage in a moderate level of physical activity after cancer treatment (e.g., 150 minutes of
moderate aerobic exercise (such as fast walking, cycling, or swimming) per week with an additional 2 to 3 strength training (such as weight lifting) sessions per week, unless contraindicated. • Walking programs are generally safe for most cancer survivors; the American College of Sports Medicine recommends that cancer survivors can begin this type of program after consulting with their doctors, but without any formal exercise testing (such as a stress test). • Survivors at higher risk of injury (e.g., those living with neuropathy, cardiomyopathy, or other long-term effects of therapy other than comorbidities) should be referred to a physical therapist of exercise specialist. Breast cancer survivors with lymphedema should also consider meeting with an exercise specialist before initiating upper body strength-training exercise.

Psychosocial Interventions
• Cognitive behavioral therapy/behavioral therapy can reduce fatigue in cancer survivors. • Psycho-educational therapies/educational therapies can reduce fatigue in cancer survivors. • Survivors should be referred to psychosocial service providers who specialize in cancer and are trained to deliver empirically-
based interventions. Psychosocial resources that address fatigue may also be available through the National Cancer Institute (e.g., Moving Beyond Breast Cancer videos).

Mind-Body Interventions
• There is some evidence that the following interventions can reduce fatigue in cancer survivors: o Mindfulness-based approaches o Yoga o Acupuncture
• The following interventions may offer some benefit, however additional research, particularly in the post-treatment population, is needed: o Biofield therapies (touch therapy), massage, music therapy, relaxation, reiki, qigong

Pharmacologic Interventions
• Evidence suggests that psychostimulants (e.g., methylphenidate) and other wakefulness agents, eg., modafinil can be effectively used to manage fatigue in patients with advanced disease or those on active treatment. However, there is very limited evidence of their effectiveness in reducing fatigue in patients who are disease free following active treatment, outside of the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea.
• Small pilot studies have evaluated the impact of supplements, such as ginseng and vitamin D, for cancer-related fatigue. However, there is no consistent evidence of their effectiveness.
Ongoing Monitoring and Follow-up Promote ongoing self-monitoring of fatigue levels as a late or long-term cancer or treatment problem in post-treatment survivors.
