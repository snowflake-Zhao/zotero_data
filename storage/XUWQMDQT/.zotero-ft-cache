Background: Local excision as the main alternative for fertility-sparing surgery (FSS) has been widely used in patients with early-stage cervical cancer to achieve fertility preservation, but its safety and practicability are still questioned. Therefore, we evaluated the current application of local excision in early-stage cervical cancer with this population-based study and compared its efficacy with hysterectomy. Materials and Methods: Women diagnosed with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO)
D stage I cervical cancer at childbearing age (18-49 years) recorded in the Surveillance,
Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database from 2000 to 2017 were included.
E Overall survival (OS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) rates were compared
between local excision and hysterectomy.
T Results:
A total of 18,519 patients of reproductive age with cervical cancer were included, and
P 2,268 deaths were observed. 17.0% of patients underwent FSS via local excision, and
70.1% underwent hysterectomy. Among patients younger than 39 years, OS and DSS
E of local excision were comparable to those of hysterectomy, whereas, in patients older
than 40 years, OS and DSS of local excision were significantly worse than those of hysterectomy. In addition, OS and DSS of local excision were similar to hysterectomy
C in patients with stage IA cervical cancer, but OS and DSS were inferior to
hysterectomy in patients with stage IB cervical cancer who underwent local excision.
C Multivariate Cox analysis showed no substantial difference in OS between local Aexcision and hysterectomy.
Conclusion: For patients without fertility requirements, hysterectomy remains the best therapeutic option. However, for patients under 40 years of age diagnosed with stage IA cervical cancer, FSS via local excision is a viable option that can achieve a well-balanced outcome between tumor control and fertility preservation.

Introduction For decades, cervical cancer has been recognized as a long-lasting and significant global health issue1,2. As one of the most common malignancies that affect the female genitourinary system, cervical cancer accounted for an estimated 604,000 new cases and 342,000 deaths in 2020 3. The high incidence is accompanied by an alarming trend toward younger age groups for cervical cancer 4. Greater than 25% of women with cervical cancer are under 40 years old, with the proportion of younger women affected by cervical cancer has been on the rise over the past three decades, ranging
D from 10% to 40% 5 6 7.
Cervical cancer constitutes a significant threat to women’s reproductive health. Apart
E from the physical and psychological trauma of this condition, the impact on women's
willingness to conceive, the fear of subsequent impaired fertility, and both sexual
T health and quality of life should be taken into account. Although most young cervical
cancer patients are diagnosed in the early stages of the disease, the standard curative
P therapies are hysterectomy and radiotherapy, both of which inevitably affect fertility
and impede future childbearing, and may also, to some extent, lead to physical and
E psychological disorders and reduced the quality of life 8 9. This raises the challenging
question of whether it is possible to preserve the uterus without increasing the risk of cancer recurrence, thereby allowing women the opportunity to have children.
C For women of reproductive age with early-stage cervical cancer who have a strong
desire for fertility, local excision, as the major approach of fertility-sparing surgery
C (FSS), has been introduced to achieve the preservation of fertility 10 11. Local excision Aincludes, but is not limited to cryosurgery, electrocautery, excisional biopsy, laser
ablation, or thermal ablation 12 13. The safety and impact on fertility of local excision have been somewhat validated in extensive follow-ups at several medical institutions. A single-center study conducted in Germany reported favorable fertility and oncologic outcomes among 16 patients who underwent local excision for early-stage cervical cancer during the 8-year follow-up period, with nine pregnancies and mostly spontaneous conceptions, and no recurrence of cervical cancer within the investigated time range 14. Similarly, a study involving 91 Czech women showed that in patients

with cervical cancer with a maximum diameter of less than 2 cm and infiltration of less than half of the interstitial cervical space, the recurrence rate was an acceptable 5.0% with no mortality in patients who underwent local excision over 20 years 15. Despite the findings of these meta-analyses and case-control studies, a lack of large studies comparing local excision and hysterectomy for early-stage cervical cancer persists. This study was performed to investigate the current applications of local excision for early-stage cervical cancer, and to explore whether FSS via local excision could produce an equivalent, or even superior prognosis when compared with
D hysterectomy. E Material and Methods
Data sources and study population
T This retrospective population study used data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology,
and End Results (SEER) program. The SEER database is one of the largest
P population-based cancer registries in the United States, with a substantial collection of
real-world cancer data covering nearly 28% of the U.S. population to present current
E demographics, incidence, survival, and cancer treatment. This study followed the
Strengthening the Reporting of Cohort Studies in Surgery (STROCSS) reporting guidelines 16, Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/JS9/A381.
C Women who were diagnosed with first primary cervical cancer (International
Classification of Diseases for Oncology, third edition [ICD-O-3] codes: C53.0-C53.9)
C from 2000 to 2017 recorded in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results A(SEER) database were included. Patients diagnosed solely by autopsy or death
certificates were excluded, as were those without a microscopic confirmation of the cancer diagnosis. We further excluded patients under 18 years of age and those without complete follow-up information, including follow-up time and age at diagnosis. In addition, we excluded patients for whom the type of surgical intervention was unknown or those treated with local tumor destruction to accurately assess the effect of surgical intervention (Figure 1). We included 18,519 cases of early-stage cervical cancer at 18-49 years old. Patients aged 50 years and older were

also included for comparison (Figure S1, Supplemental Digital Content 2, http://links.lww.com/JS9/A382).
Definition of variables All patients were on follow-up from the time of the first initial diagnosis of cervical cancer until they died, withdrew from the study alive, or at the end of the study (December 31, 2017). For the patients included in this study, we assessed the following variables: age at diagnosis, sex, race, Hispanic origin, year of diagnosis,
D urban/rural residency at diagnosis, median household income, FIGO (The
International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics) stage, surgical procedure,
E histological types, duration of follow-up, and the vital status at the end of the
follow-up. For cervical cancer, the T value, N value, and M value of the stage were
T based on AJCC 3rd stage codes for patients diagnosed between 2000 and 2003, AJCC
6th stage codes for patients diagnosed between 2004 and 2009, AJCC 7th stage codes
P for patients diagnosed between 2010 and 2015, and SEER combined stage for patients
diagnosed in 2016 and 2017 17 18 Since the SEER database documents survival in
E months, and one month is the shortest interval of time available for analysis, survival
shorter than one month was recorded as 0 months in the SEER database. Age at cancer diagnosis was categorized as 18–24 years, 25-29 years, 30-34 years, 35-39
C years, 40-44 years, and 45-49 years. Two surgical procedures for cervical cancer were
compared: local excision and hysterectomy. The procedure codes for local excision
C are 20-29 and encompass, but are not restricted to, cryosurgery, electrocautery, Aexcisional biopsy, laser ablation or thermal ablation, and combinations thereof. The
surgical code for hysterectomy is 30-62. Regardless of whether the fallopian tubes or ovaries are removed, as long as the uterus is removed it is incorporated as a hysterectomy. This includes total hysterectomy, radical or extended hysterectomy, etc. We further assessed urban/rural residency at diagnosis and the patient's median household income to be reflective of the patient's socioeconomic circumstance. These variables were based on the assessment of a county's demographic and socioeconomic conditions, for the most part, a direct evaluation of the properties of the target

population in the survey sample data.
Statistical analysis We characterized stage I cervical patients and compared them according to the type of surgical procedures used. Surgical operation trends were assessed according to age and year of diagnosis. The overall survival (OS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) were calculated by the Kaplan–Meier method. The OS rate was determined as the percentage of survivors (all causes of death) after follow-up. The DSS rate was
D measured as the percentage of patients who did not die from cervical cancer (rather
than other causes) within the defined time. Cox regression models were employed to
E evaluate whether there were any significant differences in survival outcomes between
the two different treatments. Multivariate Cox analyses were designed to account for
T patients’ baseline characteristics, tumor-related features, and socioeconomic factors.
All analyses were performed using SEER*Stat software version 8.3.8 and R 3.6.3. All
P statistical tests were two-sided, and values with P<0.05 were considered statistically
significant.
E Results
Baseline characteristics
C A total of 2,268 fatalities occurred among 18,519 patients of reproductive age with
stage I cervical cancer, with a median follow-up of 6.5 years (range: 0-17.9 years).
C The predominant age of patients was 40-44 years (24.9%), followed by 35-39 years A(23.9%) and 45-49 years (19.9%). Patients were primarily white (79%), non-Hispanic
(74.4%), and resided in urban areas (89.8%), with a median household income (72.3%). Squamous cell carcinomas made up the majority of the tumors (61.5%). Of stage I cervical cancer patients, 87.1% underwent surgery as their first course of treatment, with 17.0% undergoing FSS through local excision and 70.1% undergoing radical hysterectomy (Table 1).
Prevalence of surgical procedures by age at cancer diagnosis

The vast majority of patients with early-stage cervical cancer were surgically treated. Specifically, for stage I patients, there was a consistent increase in the number of patients who underwent radical hysterectomy as an initial treatment , from ages 18 to 49. The proportion of stage I patients undergoing FSS via local excision was in excess of half at the age of 18-19 years, and this proportion then decreased sharply with increasing age, fluctuating at less than 10% for those aged 45-49 years (Figure 2).
Survival analysis of stage I patients by surgical intervention
D The OS and DSS in those who underwent FSS via local excision were significantly
better in patients who underwent surgery compared to those who did not receive
E surgery (5-year OS: 92.0% vs. 66.2%, p = 0.7; 5-year DSS: 93.4% vs. 69.4%, p =
0 .4), but were similar as those undergoing hysterectomy (5-year OS: 92.0%; 5-year
T DSS: 93.3%) (Figure 3).
To obviate the influence of baseline patient characteristics, tumor characteristics, and
P socioeconomic factors, OS and DSS analyses were further conducted with a Cox
regression model adjusted by age at diagnosis, race, year of diagnosis, Hispanic origin,
E median household income, urban/rural residency at diagnosis, histology, and surgical
procedure. In multivariable Cox analyses, both OS (HR: 1.08; 95% CI: 0.94-1.24; p = 0.268) and DSS (HR: 1.00; 95% CI: 0.86-1.184; p = 1) for local excision were not
C substantially different from a radical hysterectomy (Table 2).
The OS and DSS of local excision were similar to that of hysterectomy for stage IA
C cervical cancer (OS: p = 0.7; DSS: p = 0.2), but the OS and DSS of local excision Awere worse than a radical hysterectomy for stage IB cervical cancer (OS: p < 0.001;
DSS: p < 0.001) (Figure 4). The HRs of local excision were stable from 18 to 34 years of age but increased dramatically from 39 years of age. The therapeutic effects of local excision decreased notably by age and were significantly worse than hysterectomy in patients older than 40 years (Figure 5).
Survival analysis of patients with stage I cervical cancer by age at cancer diagnosis To avoid the effects of age on survival analyses, we further investigated the long-term

prognosis after local excision (Figure 6-7). We found that the OS and DSS of local excision were no worse than those of hysterectomy in patients younger than 39 years, and the prognosis was even better for patients younger than 34 years (5-year OS: 18-24 years: 94.0% versus 88.8%, p = 0.07; 25-29 years: 96.0% versus 90.5%, p < 0.001; 30-34 years: 96.4% versus 91.3%, p < 0.001; 35-39 years: 93.4% versus 94.0%, p = 1; 5-year DSS: 18-24 years: 94.6% versus 90.7%, p = 0.1; 25-29 years: 96.4% versus 91.7%, p < 0.001; 30-34 years: 97.0% versus 91.9%, p < 0.001; 35-39 years: 94.2% versus 94.8%, p = 0.6). For patients aged 40 years, OS and DSS were
D markedly worse for local excision than for radical hysterectomy (5-year OS: 40-44
years: 85.9% versus 91.6%, p < 0.001; 45-49 years: 78.9% versus 91.7%, p < 0.001;
E 5-year DSS: 40-44 years: 89.5% versus 93.4%, p < 0.001; 45-49 years: 82.5% versus
93.3%, p < 0.001). The graphical representation in Figure 8 depicts a superior
T survival rate associated with local excision compared to hysterectomy for early-stage
cervical cancer patients younger than 39 years of age, in terms of both 5-year OS and
P DSS. Furthermore, Figures S2, Supplemental Digital Content 3,
http://links.lww.com/JS9/A383 and S3, Supplemental Digital Content 4,
E http://links.lww.com/JS9/A384 respectively displayed the results of COX analysis of
the outcomes of two surgical treatment options, local excision and hysterectomy, for patients with stage IA and IB cervical cancer.
C Analysis of the causes of death in patients with stage I cervical cancer with different C surgical approaches AThe study investigated the cumulative mortality rate (CMR) of various causes of
death in patients with FIGO Stage I cervical cancer who underwent surgical intervention. As shown in Figure 9, patients who underwent FSS via local excision had higher rates of death from infectious diseases than those who underwent hysterectomy. However, patients who underwent hysterectomy exhibited a higher cumulative incidence of deaths from gastrointestinal diseases during the early follow-up and from cancer-related deaths later in follow-up, although the differences did not reach statistical significance.

Discussion From a retrospective of more than 18,000 patients of reproductive age with early-stage cervical cancer, we compared the prevalence and long-term outcomes of local excision and hysterectomy for stage I cervical cancer. Our findings indicated that the majority of reproductive-age women with stage I cervical cancer received hysterectomy as initial treatment, while only 17.0 % were treated with FSS via local excision. This phenomenon was also verified in another SEER study containing 6359
D cases, where younger age was an independent determinant of the choice of local
excision in patients with early-stage cervical cancer 19.
E Despite the low application rate, FSS via local excision has shown a similar prognosis
as the commonly used hysterectomy in women aged 18-39 with stage I cervical
T cancer, indicating that it has the capability to achieve high-quality tumor clearance
while conserving fertility. In the context of a parallel increase in the number of
P women at the age of first marriage, and the growing number of women who are
choosing to delay childbearing or remain unmarried for a variety of reasons, fertility
E preservation will be an imperative element in enhancing the quality of life and social
stability of women of reproductive age. Local excision offers a viable alternative for patients and families to make informed decisions about cancer treatment based on
C therapeutic benefits, social situations, personal beliefs, and preferences 20 21. Besides,
due to the concerns of incomplete resection and tumor residual by local excision,
C careful preoperative clinical and histologic assessments of the patient, involving Apreoperative pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), contrast computed axial
tomography (CT), and positron emission tomography (PET), are recommended prior to this approach to properly evaluate for parametrial and possible lymphadenopathy. Moreover, special cautions should be taken when employing this approach, including active routine surveillance and even adjuvant radiochemotherapy, to ensure effective treatment outcomes and reduce the risk of cancer recurrence 22 23. Meanwhile, we found that the therapeutic effects of local excision remain unsatisfactory for patients aged 40 years and older. Advancing age can have a

considerable bearing on medical decision-making in cancer patients 24. Although a study from Taiwan involving 156 patients with cervical cancer showed no significant association between local excision and women's age, as well as clinical elements such as length of hospitalization, in-hospital mortality, and in-hospital complications, the absence of critical information such as cancer stage and pathology reports in the cases could have profound impacts on their results. Additionally, the limited amount of outcome events of readmission, in-hospital complications, etc, and unadjusted results in their analyses of related outcomes stratified by age render their conclusions less
D reliable 25. In contrast, an epidemiological and clinical analysis from Japan backed up
our results. They confirmed that cervical cancer cases under 39 years of age will have
E a superior prognosis in both localized and advanced lesions, regardless of histological
type 26.
T Considering that stage IB cervical cancer typically features a more pronounced
microscopic lesion than stage IA, we hypothesized that the prognosis of local excision
P may vary depending on the precise stage classification according to FIGO 27. In our
study, we observed a similar prognosis for local excision and hysterectomy in stage
E IA, whereas local excision in stage IB was much less therapeutic than hysterectomy. A
previous SEER study showed that hysterectomy did not confer a better prognosis than local excision for patients with stage IA cervical cancer, regardless of whether the
C type was squamous or more invasive adenocarcinoma. This demonstrates that for
patients with early-stage cervical cancer with prospective fertility plans, a more
C conservative local excision option is appropriate, and this is independent of the cell Atype 28. This can minimize the damage patients suffer during surgery, improve their
quality of life, and can reduce healthcare costs. It is worth noting, however, that a considerably more cautious attitude should be held toward patients with stage IB cervical cancer. Although research utilizing the NCDB database showed similar survival rates even for stage IB patients of reproductive age (hysterectomy 92.1%, 95% CI 88.2-94.8%, vs. local excision 93.6%, 95% CI 88.0-96.6%, p = 0.44), it is necessary to take into account that their conclusive findings are on the basis of approximately 30% of the patient cohort being classified as stage IB NOS. Therefore,

it is difficult to draw conclusions that are applicable to the IB1 population 29. Philippe Morice et al. also concluded, after reviewing studies on fertility-preserving surgery published from 1987-2016, that for patients with stage IB2 or IIA1, fertility-sparing surgery is not recommended 22. We acknowledge several limitations of our study. Firstly, considering its descriptive and retrospective study design, we were unable to prospectively appraise the effect of surgical interventions on early cervical cancer patients or derive causal inferences. Secondly, due to the limited data included in the SEER database, we could not
D perform a comprehensive risk adjustment. Information on patients' physical status,
comorbidities, the extent of local excision, surgical route (abdominal, vaginal, or
E minimally invasive), and presence of lymphatic space invasion in the tumor were not
captured in the database, but all of these factors are pertinent to the prognosis. Thirdly,
T we lacked data on postoperative fertility outcomes. Since miscarriage, preterm
delivery, and stillbirth are all emotionally distressing situations, fertility and obstetric
P outcomes should be given additional consideration along with oncologic outcomes to
determine the most appropriate individual treatment modality. Nonetheless, our study
E benefits from the inclusion of a large number of patients and represents one of the
largest comparisons between local excision and hysterectomy for early-stage cervical cancer, which could provide valuable insights into the current clinical practice.
C Conclusions C The selection of surgical intervention for patients with early-stage cervical cancer Ashould be based on the experience of the medical team and discussions with the
patient or family and, more importantly, on objective tumor statistics as well as a comprehensive assessment of prognosis. This study suggests that hysterectomy remains the best treatment for patients without fertility requirements. For patients under 40 years of age with stage IA cervical cancer, FSS via local excision is a viable alternative. Local excision can achieve a good balance between tumor control and preservation of fertility and can yield therapeutic results comparable to hysterectomy in women of childbearing age. However, additional prospective studies are needed to

validate the efficacy, prognosis, and reproductive outcomes of local excision in these patients, in an effort to balance the best chance of cure with the most desirable fertility outcomes.
