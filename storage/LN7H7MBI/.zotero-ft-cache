Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionized metastatic melanoma treatment, but our knowledge of ICI activity across age groups is insufﬁcient. Patients in different age groups with advanced melanoma were selected based on the ICI approval time in this study. Patients with melanoma were identiﬁed in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Result (SEER) database program 2004–2016. The results showed that 4,040 patients had advanced melanoma before the advent of ICI (referred to as the “non-ICI era”), whereas there were 6,188 cases after ICI approval (referred to as the “ICI era”). In all age groups, the cases were dominated by men. The differences between the ﬁrst (20–59 years) and second (60–74 years) age groups in both eras were signiﬁcant in terms of surgery performance and holding of insurance policies (p = 0.05). The ﬁrst and second groups (20–59 and 60–70 years old, respectively) showed no difference in survival (median = 8 months) during the non-ICI era, but the difference was evident in the ﬁrst, second, and third age groups in the ICI era, with the younger group (20–59 years) having signiﬁcantly better survival (median = 18, 14, and 10 months, respectively, p = 0.0001). Multivariate analysis of the ﬁrst group (the youngest) in the ICI era revealed that surgery was signiﬁcantly associated with an increase in survival among patients compared with those who did not undergo surgery (p < 0.0001). Furthermore, having an insurance policy among all age groups in the ICI era was associated with favorable survival in the ﬁrst (20–59 years) and second (60–74 years) age groups (p = 0.0001), while there were no survival differences in the older ICI group (>74 years). Although there were differences in survival between the ICI era and the non-ICI era, these results demonstrate that ICI

positively affected the survival of younger patients with advanced melanoma (ﬁrst age group) than it had beneﬁcial effects on older patients. Moreover, having had cancer surgery and holding an insurance policy were positive predictors for patient survival. This study emphasizes that adequate clinical and preclinical studies are important to enhance ICI outcomes across age groups.

INTRODUCTION
The ﬁrst immune check inhibitor (ICI) was approved for melanoma treatment in 2011 (ipilimumab). Immunotherapy has demonstrated a signiﬁcant improvement in progressionfree and overall survival (OS) compared with other therapeutic approaches across multiple cancers and has revolutionized the therapeutic landscape of melanoma (1, 2). Cytotoxic Tlymphocyte-associated protein-4 (CTLA-4) and programmed death protein-1 (PD-1) have emerged as the standard ICIs, establishing a valuable role in the curative and non-curative settings (3).
Aging is associated with increased immune dysfunction involving notable changes in the innate and adaptive immunity (4). Hematopoiesis is most strongly biased toward myeloid development, whereas lymphopoiesis retracts with age. Various age-related changes common to peripheral T-cell populations include less naive T cells, high numbers of terminally differentiated T cells, and reduced expressions of co-stimulatory molecules. Although recent studies have reported variations in the age-related outcomes in different cancer types (5–7), they are mostly short reports and case series and did not discuss the speciﬁc age groups with their clinical traits in a large cohort. In the setting of elderly patients with melanoma, there is an unmet systemic need; the evidence is limited to the correlative analysis between age ranges and treatment response, and no populationbased study has been conducted (8).
In this work, we addressed the research gap in the efﬁcacy of ICI patients with melanoma by evaluating the effects of ICI on a large cohort of patients with advanced melanoma and analyzing the association with OS in speciﬁc age groups.
STUDY COHORTS
The ethical statement of permission to access the SEER research data ﬁles was obtained by using SEER 18 Regs Custom Data (with additional treatment ﬁelds), Nov 2018 Sub (1975–2016 varying). According to the exemption regulations, use of the data released by the SEER database does not require informed patient consent. Patients were identiﬁed from SEER 2018 with additional treatment ﬁelds through SEER*Stat software (version 8.3.9.1). The SEER program of the National Cancer Institute is responsible for the collection and reporting of cancer incidence and survival data from several populations

based on central cancer registries that cover approximately 30% of the US population. The SEER data include patient demographic information, primary tumor site, tumor morphology, stage at diagnosis, the ﬁrst course of cancer treatment, and vital status.
We collected the SEER data for the cohort of patients from the latest registry with additional treatment ﬁelds using the SEER*Stat software (version 8.3.9.1). Following the US Food and Drug Administration approval of ICI use (9), the appropriate codes for advanced melanoma (III and IV) were selected as site recode ICD-3/WHO2008 (melanoma of the skin) according to the 6th AJCC edition (2004–2015) and Derived SEER Cmb Stg Grp (2016 onwards). Furthermore, 2004–2010 was selected and compared with the 2011–2016 period to investigate the effects of this variable on patients with advanced melanoma. All patients were designated based on follow-up (active follow-up). Only those microscopically conﬁrmed cases via histology, exfoliative cytology, immunophenotyping, and nonspeciﬁc microscopic methods, active follow-up, and ﬁrst primary or ﬁrst only were included. The following variables were evaluated: age groups (20–59 years as the ﬁrst group, 60–74 years as the second group, and >74 years as the third group); year of diagnosis by contemporary intervals; all months of survival; grade (I–II, III–IV, or other); sex (male or female); available information (2011–2016) on the sites of metastasis (mets) (bone, brain, liver, or lung); primary site labeled (trunk, upper limb, lower limb, or others); race (white, black, or other); radiation therapy (beam radiation or radioisotopes); radioactive implants (yes or no); chemotherapy (yes or no); vital status (dead or alive); laterality (right, left, or others); patient ID; marital status; and holder of an insurance policy or not. Known survival with 24 months as the cutoff value was selected. The detailed criteria for inclusion and exclusion are described in Figure 1.
Patients’ baseline demographics were compared using c2 test depending on the diagnosis of advanced melanoma. The median OS was analyzed using the Kaplan–Meier method via a log-rank test, and the Cox proportional hazard model was used for multivariate analysis in SPSS. Statistical signiﬁcance was considered at p-values less than 0.05 and a limit of 0.0001.
RESULTS
We extracted 10,228 cases with advanced melanoma, 4,040 of which were recorded before the advent of ICI (non-ICI

era) and 6,188 cases had the same disease when ICI was developed (ICI era), with 24 months as the survival cutoff. The cases predominantly consisted of males. Results of the comparison of both eras for the ﬁrst and second groups revealed that laterality; chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgery; and the holding of an insurance policy were signiﬁcantly different in the ﬁrst and second age groups (p ≤ 0.05), whereas only radiation therapy and surgery were not in the third age group (p = 0.0001). These characteristics are summarized in Table 1.
In the study of age group disparities in OS differences between the non-ICI and the ICI era, it was revealed that there were no signiﬁcant survival differences in the ﬁrst and second groups in the non-ICI era (median = 8 months) and that the older group had worse survival [median = 7 months, hazard ratio (HR) = 1.16, CI = 1.07–1.26, p = 0.0001], while the difference between the groups in the ICI era was clearly shown in the ﬁrst, second, and third age groups (median = 18, 14, and 10 months, respectively, p < 0.0001) (Figure 2). We studied the general OS

difference between the non-ICI and ICI eras, with signiﬁcant positive survival for those in the ICI era (p < 0.0001) (Supplementary File 1). We considered three age groups to classify the patients. Across the age cohorts, we found differences in OS only in the ﬁrst group in the comparison of patients treated with or without ICI (i.e., in the pre-ICI or the ICI era), with an improvement in the median survival of almost all variables, sex, marital status, surgery use, and insurance, in the ICI era (p < 0.05) (Table 2). By studying differences in OS in the ICI group, we found that being female, married, and having had surgery had beneﬁcial favorable survival (p = 0.05). Whereas having insurance had better survival for the ﬁrst (20–59 years) and second (60–74 years) groups (p = 0.05), there was no difference in insurance use for the old group (p = 0.7) (Figure 3). In the study of the sites of metastasis and their effects on survival in the age groups of the ICI era, we found that mets sites have worse survival than do non-metastatic cases (Supplementary File 2). In the comparative study of the sites of metastasis in the age groups of the ICI era, a difference was

Bone metastasis showed fair association and only signiﬁcant marginal differences were presented in the ﬁrst age group (p = 0.046) (Figure 4). In the study of the differences in the mets sites in the ICI group, liver metastasis was associated with shorter median months of survival in the ﬁrst (20–59 years) and second (60–74 years) age groups (median = 4 vs. 3 months), whereas

brain metastasis was associated with worse survival in the older group (>74 years; median = 2 months, p = 0.006) (Figure 5).
In the univariate analysis, being female, married, having had surgery, and insured patients showed signiﬁcant positive survival beneﬁts in the three groups of the ICI era.

associated with an increase in survival compared with those who did not undergo surgery (HR = 1.536, CI = 1.258–1.874, p < 0.0001; HR = 2.103, CI = 1.750–2.527, p = 0.0001), whereas only surgery was an independent factor, where having undergone surgery was related with better survival than nonsurgery in the older group. The presence of metastatic sites was associated with lower survival in all age groups (p = 0.0001) and increased signiﬁcant OS difference between mets in the same group with increasing age (Tables 3A–C).
DISCUSSION
Age is an essential prognostic factor in patients with aggressive malignant melanoma, and the prognosis worsens with age (10).

Differences in the natural history of melanoma among younger and older patients are speculated to be partly caused by immunosenescence, facilitating the escape of melanoma cells from effective immune surveillance (11). Clinical trials conducted in the last decade have investigated the effects of ICIs on various solid cancer types, including cancers that are difﬁcult to treat, such as melanoma. Results have consistently revealed that ICIs can improve the OS of patients with malignant melanoma, either in combination with other ICI agents (i.e., ipilimumab and nivolumab) or in monotherapy (12, 13). However, systematic investigations on the inﬂuence of speciﬁc age on the prognosis of patients with melanoma receiving ICIs are largely missing.
In the present population-based study, the effects of ICIs on the different age groups were evaluated, and the differences

among these groups in terms of survival were examined. The results revealed that ICIs had excellent survival beneﬁts for younger patients than for elderly patients with melanoma. In the non-ICI era, there was no difference between the ﬁrst (2059) and second ( 60-74) age groups, with less favorable survival in the older group ( > 74). These results suggest that the beneﬁts of immunotherapy have been introduced for better survival, but further age disparities have risen. The increase in survival was primarily attributed to the introduction of immunotherapeutic drugs in therapeutic regimens. This improvement was notably lower than that reported in prior studies (14), which designated only 24 months as the cutoff value for survival in the younger age group regardless of their status and other comorbidities. The present results also revealed that most variables demonstrated signiﬁcant unfavorable OS in the age groups (i.e., ﬁrst group) in the non-ICI era. Several studies have reported that ICIbased multimodal treatments can remarkably enhance the anticancer activity across different diseases (15). There have been reports on the effects of immunotherapy in older patients. While no difference in the survival among the nonyounger groups after introducing ICI has been reported (16),

another study has reported that a subgroup of older patients had greater survival than did the younger group (17). In addition to the cohort number and the different locations, these results could be related to the missed and non-included variables almost related to the impact of age. Another reason is that, assuming quality and high-performing healthcare settings, with universal healthcare, can more easily replicate the context of clinical trials (18, 19). However, this is insufﬁcient to capture the full landscape of disparities in elderly care—and maybe oversimpliﬁed. Consequently, there are numerous variables that we cannot account for, resulting in the ﬁndings of our study.
In our study, the age groups in the ICI era were fairly treated with chemotherapy as its frequency is less than that of chemotherapy non-use. Thus, almost all ICIs were suggested to be administered in patients with melanoma, further supporting the present results of improved beneﬁts in the ICI era compared to the non-ICI era. Selected patients with melanoma may be eligible for treatment with radiotherapy, brain disease control, or other palliative services (20). Our study showed a positive correlation between ICIs plus radiotherapy and OS, thereby supporting the idea of

synergistic effects. However, without speciﬁc knowledge of the types and districts of delivery, this ﬁnding is largely speculative (21). The effect of radiotherapy seemed limited to the nonyounger aged population; the results of Cox multivariate analysis conﬁrmed that its effect was insigniﬁcant in nonyounger patients. The patients in the ICI era who also underwent surgery had signiﬁcantly better survival outcomes than those in the non-ICI era who did not undergo surgery, indicating that surgery could be a predictive factor for favorable survival in all age subgroups in the ICI era. In general, the combination of local–locoregional approaches to integrate and optimize ICI treatments in patients with melanoma is currently common and can help improve progression-free survival and or proceed beyond progression. This ﬁnding holds when the disease progression pattern during ICI treatment regards a few sites, which can be surgically approached or tackled with radiotherapy, resulting in one interpretation of the correlative analysis. Previous studies reported favorable survival when distant melanoma tissues were removed via surgery after checkpoint blockade, especially when they responded to ICI treatment (22, 23). Administration of chemotherapy was highly observed in patients in the non-ICI era, mostly because it was the only treatment modality available. Having an insurance policy played an important role in various treatment regimens,

especially in the ICI era. Unlike younger age groups (20-59), the older ICI age groups OS was not related to insurance availability. Recent work has reported that melanoma patients younger than 65 years who were insured in the ICI era had higher OS than those who did not have an insurance policy (24, 25), suggesting an inﬂuence on the likelihood of accessing treatment affordably. At the same time, patients with mets had worse survival than did those in the non-mets group, and the difference in OS between the mets sites within each age group clearly increased throughout the ICI era. While brain metastasis was related to poor survival in the older group, the liver mets site was poorly associated with shorter survival in most cases and coincided with the results of a cohort of clinical trials (26).
The present study has several limitations. Firstly, the database we consulted did not expound on speciﬁc age groups with melanoma. Secondly, the short median OS was associated with a 24-month follow-up only, comorbidities were not examined, and there was lack of information on the performance status. There was no chance to clarify whether patients had received anti-CTLA4, anti-PD1, or both. Eventually, we could not investigate whether elderly patients had experienced more toxicity from ICIs, impairing the dose exposure and reducing the durable beneﬁt of disease control, and what comorbidities were speciﬁcally prominent, including

CONCLUSION
Our results indicated that age-related disparities might affect the OS outcomes in patients with metastatic melanoma in both the ICI and non-ICI eras. ICIs had clear signiﬁcant effects on all groups, but signiﬁcantly improved the OS of patients younger than 59 years. Surgical removal of metastatic melanoma and having an insurance policy were found to be positive predictors for OS in most cases. In addition to the independent predictive factor of surgery, this study highlights the importance of access to government-sponsored insurance programs in overcoming age-based inequalities in healthcare outcomes, especially in the era of ICI.
