    Abstract
    BACKGROUND

    Adjuvant therapy for women with T1–T2 breast carcinoma and 1–3 positive lymph nodes is controversial due to discrepancies in reported baseline locoregional recurrence (LRR) risks. This inconsistency has been attributed to variations in lymph node staging techniques, which have yielded different numbers of dissected lymph nodes. The current study evaluated the prognostic impact of the percentage of positive/dissected lymph nodes on recurrence and survival in women with one to three positive lymph nodes.
    METHODS

    The study cohort was comprised of 542 women with pathologic T1–T2 breast carcinoma who had 1–3 positive lymph nodes and who had undergone mastectomy and received adjuvant systemic therapy without radiotherapy. Ten-year Kaplan–Meier (KM) LRR, distant recurrence (DR), and overall survival (OS) rates stratified by the number of positive lymph nodes, the number of dissected lymph nodes, and the percentage of positive lymph nodes were examined using different cut-off levels. Multivariate analysis was performed to evaluate the prognostic significance of the percentage of positive lymph nodes in disease recurrence and survival.
    RESULTS

    The median follow-up was 7.5 years. LRR, DR, and OS rates correlated significantly with the number of positive lymph nodes and the percentage of positive lymph nodes, but not with the number of dissected lymph nodes. The cut-off level at which the most significant difference in LRR was observed was 25% positive lymph nodes (the 10-year KM LRR rates were 13.9% and 36.7% in women with ≤ 25% and > 25% positive lymph nodes, respectively; P < 0.0001). Higher DR rates and lower OS rates were observed among patients who had > 25% positive lymph nodes compared with patients who had ≤ 25% positive lymph nodes (DR: 53.0% vs. 30.3%, respectively; P < 0.0001; OS: 43.4% vs. 62.6%, respectively; P < 0.0001). In the multivariate analysis, the percentage of positive lymph nodes and the histologic grade were significant, independent factors associated with LRR, DR, and OS.
    CONCLUSIONS

    The presence of > 25% positive lymph nodes was an adverse prognostic factor in patients with 1–3 positive nodes and may be used to identify patients at high risks of postmastectomy locoregional and distant recurrence who may benefit with adjuvant radiotherapy and more aggressive systemic therapy regimens.

This inconsistency has been attributed to variations in lymph node staging techniques, which have yielded different num- bers of dissected lymph nodes.

The cut-off level at which the most significant difference in LRR was observed was 25% positive lymph nodes (the 10-year KM LRR rates were 13.9% and 36.7% in women with  25% and  25% positive lymph nodes, respectively; P  0.0001). Higher DR rates and lower OS rates were observed among patients who had  25% positive lymph nodes compared with patients who had  25% positive lymph nodes (DR: 53.0% vs. 30.3%, respectively; P  0.0001; OS: 43.4% vs. 62.6%, respectively; P  0.0001).

that measure  5 cm and 1–3 positive axillary lymph nodes is less clear. 1–3 This controversy is related to discrepancies in the reported locoregional recurrence (LRR) risks in the absence of radiotherapy among these patients. In two randomized trials of PMRT that were conducted by the Danish Breast Cancer Cooper- ative Group, LRR rates in patients with 1–3 positive lymph nodes who received systemic therapy but did not receive radiotherapy were approximately 30% at 10 years. 4,5 These risks were considerably greater com - pared with the rates observed in the British Columbia Cancer Agency (BCCA) randomized trial (16% at 10 years and 33% at 15 years) 6 and in retrospective stud - ies of patients who were enrolled in systemic therapy trials (12–20% at 10 years). 7–10 This inconsistency has been attributed to variations in the extent of axillary lymph node staging, resulting in different numbers of dissected axillary lymph nodes. Recently, several institutional series reported that the percentage of positive lymph nodes may be a useful prognostic factor for survival in women with lymph node-positive breast carcinoma. 11–13 However, relatively few data are available to define the effect of the percentage of positive lymph nodes on risks of LRR. Because postmastectomy radiotherapy has the potential to optimize locoregional control and im- prove survival, 4–6,14 we were interested in evaluating whether the percentage of positive lymph nodes may be applied in patients with one to three positive lymph nodes to distinguish those at high risk who may ben- efit with adjuvant therapy from those at low risk who may be spared treatment-related toxicities. In this re- port, we provide an analysis of the prognostic signifi- cance of the percentage of positive/dissected axillary lymph nodes in a cohort of women with breast carci- noma who had pathologic T1 (pT1) or pT2 tumors and 1–3 positive lymph nodes who underwent mastectomy and received systemic therapy without adjuvant radio- therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS The Breast Cancer Outcomes Unit data base prospec- tively records tumor, treatment, and outcomes data on all patients with breast carcinoma who are referred to the BCCA. The data base was used to identify 542 women who were diagnosed between January 1, 1989 and December 31, 1997 who were referred to the BCCA with pT1–pT2 breast carcinoma and 1–3 posi- tive lymph nodes and who underwent mastectomy, which achieved clear margins, and axillary dissection of the Level I and II axillary lymph nodes. All patients received adjuvant systemic therapy. The analysis also excluded patients with established indications for PMRT, including pT3–pT4 tumors and/or  4 positive lymph nodes, patients who presented with distant metastasis, patients with unknown pathologic infor- mation on tumor and lymph node stage, histologic grade, lymphovascular invasion (LVI) status, and es- trogen receptor (ER) status. Because the objective was to evaluate the prognostic significance of the percent- age of positive lymph nodes in the absence of PMRT, patients who received radiotherapy were excluded. Data were extracted on each patient’s date of pathologic diagnosis, dates and sites of disease recur- rence, and date of death as of December 1, 2003. Patients were followed at the BCCA and in the com- munity. For patients who were discharged from the BCCA and followed by their primary care physicians, recurrence information was obtained from the com- munity physician on an annual basis. Death informa- tion was obtained from the Department of Vital Sta- tistics on a monthly basis. Patients were censored 6 months prior to the date of data retrieval, thus ensur- ing that the majority of data on disease recurrence and death up to that time had been received. Primary outcomes examined were LRR, distant recurrence (DR), and overall survival (OS). LRR was defined as the first site of tumor recurrence involving the ipsilateral chest wall (local) and/or the axillary, supraclavicular or infraclavicular, and internal mammary lymph nodes (regional). Patients with LRR that occurred simultaneously with DR were scored as having an LRR event. Patients who had LRR events that occurred after DR were censored at the time of DR. Patient age at diagnosis was examined initially in 5-year intervals and subsequently was dichotomized at 45 years, the cut-off age at which the most statisti- cally significant difference in LRR was observed on univariate analysis. The tumor factors analyzed were histology (ductal or lobular carcinoma); tumor classi- fication (T1 or T2); histologic grade (Grade 1, 2, or 3); LVI status (present or absent); and ER status (positive or negative). Lymph node factors analyzed included the number of positive axillary lymph nodes (1, 2, or 3), the number of axillary lymph nodes removed (  5 lymph nodes, 6–10 lymph nodes, 11–15 lymph nodes,  16 lymph nodes;  10 lymph nodes, or  10 lymph nodes), and the percentage of positive lymph nodes. The percentage of positive lymph nodes was exam- ined in 5-point intervals, with the cut-off percentage chosen at the level at which the most statistically significant differences in LRR were observed. Adjuvant systemic therapy was analyzed as hormone therapy alone, chemotherapy alone, or both. Prognostic Significance of % Positive Nodes/Truong et al. 2007
Statistical Analysis The 10-year Kaplan–Meier (KM) LRR, DR, and OS rates and the associated standard errors (SE) were com- puted for each patient and tumor characteristic. Sta- tistical significance of outcomes differences was de- termined using the log-rank test. Multivariate analyses of prognostic variables for each outcome were per- formed using Cox proportional hazards modeling with and without the percentage of positive lymph nodes as a covariate. All statistical tests were 2-tailed, with the level of significance established at P  0.05. All anal- yses were conducted using SPSS software (version 11.0.1; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). RESULTS The median follow-up was 7.5 years (range, 0.21–14.7 years). The median patient age at the time of diagnosis was 60 years (range, 26–94 years). Tumor and Treatment Characteristics Table 1 summarizes data on tumor and treatment characteristics of the study cohort. All patients under- went modified radical mastectomy with clear surgical margins. Axillary lymph node staging was performed in all patients. The median number of lymph nodes removed was 10 (range, 1–39 lymph nodes removed). The median percentage of positive lymph nodes was 18.7% (range, 2.6–100.0%). Adjuvant systemic therapy was used in all patients (chemotherapy alone, 23.1%; hormone therapy alone, 59.8%; both chemotherapy and hormone therapy, 17.2%). Of 218 patients who received chemotherapy, 154 patients received doxoru- bicin and cyclophosphamide; 62 patients received cy- clophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil; and 2 patients received fluorouracil, doxorubicin, and cy- clophosphamide. KM Recurrence and Survival Outcomes Overall, 46 patients (8.5%) experienced local chest wall recurrence, and 40 patients (7.4%) experienced re- gional recurrence. The combined LRR rate was 14.6% ( n  79 patients). DR occurred in 174 patients (32.1%). The corresponding 10-year KM estimates (  standard error) were 16.7  1.8% for LRR and 34.0  2.2% for DR. The 10-year KM OS rate was 59.4  2.3%. Univariate Analysis Table 2 presents comparisons of 10-year KM LRR, DR, and OS stratified by the number of positive lymph nodes, the number of dissected lymph nodes, and the percentage of positive lymph nodes using different cut-off levels. LRR, DR, and OS were correlated signif- icantly with the number of positive lymph nodes and the percentage of positive lymph nodes, but not with the number of dissected lymph nodes. The cut-off level at which the most significant difference in LRR was observed was  25% and  25% positive lymph nodes (Fig. 1). The 10-year LRR rates were 13.9% with  25% positive lymph nodes, compared to 36.7% with  25% positive lymph nodes ( P  0.0001) (Fig. 2). Patients with  25% positive lymph nodes also expe- rienced significantly higher rates of DR (Fig. 3) and lower OS (Fig. 4). Table 3 presents univariate comparisons of LRR, DR, and OS according to other clinical characteristics, including patient age, tumor factors, and type of sys- temic therapy. T2 tumor classification, Grade 3 histol- ogy, and the presence of LVI were associated with increased LRR and DR and with reduced OS. Age  45 years and ER-negative status were additional factors associated with LRR and DR, but not with OS. In the comparison of systemic therapies, hormone therapy alone was associated with lower OS compared with TABLE 1 Characteristics of the Study Cohort Characteristic No. of patients (%) Age  45 yrs 92 (17.0)  45 yrs 450 (83.0) Histology Ductal 507 (93.5) Lobular 35 (6.5) Tumor classification T1 243 (44.8) T2 299 (55.2) Grade 1 42 (7.7) 2 269 (49.6) 3 231 (42.6) Lymphovascular invasion Absent 270 (49.8) Present 272 (50.2) Estrogen receptor status Positive 426 (78.6) Negative 116 (21.4) No. of positive lymph nodes 1 326 (60.1) 2 147 (27.2) 3 69 (12.7) No of dissected lymph nodes  5 66 (12.2) 6–10 205 (37.8) 11–15 173 (31.9)  16 98 (18.1) Systemic therapy Chemotherapy alone 125 (23.1) Hormone therapy alone 324 (59.8) Both 93 (17.2) 2008 CANCER May 15, 2005 / Volume 103 / Number 10
chemotherapy alone or in combination with hormone therapy. Multivariate Analysis On multivariate analysis (Table 4), with the percentage of positive lymph nodes included in the model, the number of positive lymph nodes and the number of dissected lymph nodes were not significant. The pres- ence of  25% positive lymph nodes was associated with significantly higher LRR (hazard ratio [HR], 2.32), higher DR (HR, 1.97), and lower OS (HR, 1.79; P  0.05 for all). Aside from the percentage of positive lymph nodes, histologic grade was the other factor associated with all three outcomes of LRR, DR and OS. Age  45 years was associated significantly with higher LRR, whereas T classification and LVI were additional fac- tors that were associated significantly with DR. FIGURE 1.
