Abstract Purpose To assess the impact of postmastectomy radiotherapy (PMRT) on overall survival and relapse-free survival among breast cancer patients with T1–T2 N1 disease who received standard adjuvant systemic therapy. Methods This is an individual patient data pooled analysis of 1053 breast cancer patients referred for adjuvant therapy in three clinical trials (BIG 02/98, BCIRG001, and BCIRG005). Overall survival was assessed according to whether or not patients received adjuvant radiotherapy through Kaplan–Meier analysis. Univariate and multivariate analyses of predictors of overall and relapse-free survival were conducted through Cox regression analysis. Results Locoregional relapse rates (after a median follow up of 116 months) were 5.6% among patients who received adjuvant radiotherapy vs. 6.6% among patients who did not receive adjuvant radiotherapy. Actuarial 5- and 10-year locoregional relapse-free survival rates were 94 and 93%, respectively, among patients who did not receive adjuvant radiotherapy versus 95 and 92% among patients who received adjuvant radiotherapy. The following factors were associated with worse overall survival in multivariate Cox regression analysis: age < 40 years (P < 0.0001), T2 stage (P = 0.004), higher lymph node ratio (P < 0.0001), and negative hormone receptor status (P < 0.0001). Likewise, the following factors were predictive of shorter locoregional relapse-free survival: age Ä 40 (P < 0.0001), no PMRT (P = 0.034), ﬂuorouracil/adriamycin/cyclophosphamide (FAC) chemotherapy (P = 0.001), and higher T stage (P = 0.002). Conclusion The current analysis does not show a beneﬁcial impact of PMRT on overall or relapse-free survival among patients with T1–T2 N1 disease who received standard adjuvant systemic therapy. There is, however, evidence of improvement in locoregional relapse-free survival with PMRT. These ﬁndings need to be prospectively validated.

Auswirkungen der Strahlentherapie nach Mastektomie auf die Ergebnisse von Mammakarzinompatientinnen im Stadium T1–2 N1 Eine individuelle Patientendatenanalyse aus 3 klinischen Studien
Zusammenfassung Ziel Untersuchung der Auswirkungen der Postmastektomie-Strahlentherapie (PMRT) auf das Gesamtüberleben und das rezidivfreie Überleben von Mammakarzinompatientinnen im Stadium T1–2 N1, die anschließend eine systemische adjuvante Standardtherapie erhielten. Methoden Gepoolte individuelle Patientendatenanalyse von 1053 Mammakarzinompatientinnen mit einer adjuvanten Systemtherapie im Rahmen von drei klinischen Studien (BIG 02/98; BCIRG001, BCIRG005). Das Gesamtüberleben von Patientinnen mit und ohne adjuvante Strahlentherapie wurde mittels Kaplan-Meier-Analyse verglichen. Zur univariaten und multivariaten Analyse von unabhängigen Prädiktoren für das Gesamt- und rezidivfreie Überleben wurde eine Cox-Regression durchgeführt. Ergebnisse In einem medianen Follow-up-Zeitraum von 116 Monaten kam es in 5,1 % aller Patientinnen mit adjuvanter Strahlentherapie zum lokoregionären Rezidiv im Vergleich zu 6,4 % der nichtbestrahlten Patientinnen. Die rezidivfreien 5-Jahres- und 10-Jahres-Überlebensraten betrugen 94 und 93 % bei Patientinnen ohne bzw. 95 und 92 % mit adjuvanter Strahlentherapie. Die folgenden Faktoren waren mit einem schlechteren Gesamtüberleben in der multivariaten Cox-Regression assoziiert: Alter < 40 Jahre (P < 0,0001), T2-Stadium (P = 0,004), höheres Lymphknotenverhältnis (P < 0,0001) und negativer Hormonrezeptorstatus (P < 0,0001). Zudem waren die folgenden Faktoren prädiktiv für ein kürzeres lokoregionäres rezidivfreies Überleben: Alter < 40 (P < 0,0001), kein PMRT (P = 0,034), „Fluorouracil/Adriamycin/Cyclophosphamide“(FAC)-Chemotherapie (P = 0,001) und höheres T-Stadium (P = 0,002). Fazit Die aktuelle Analyse zeigt keinen positiven Einﬂuss der PMRT auf das Gesamt- oder rezidivfreie Überleben bei Patientinnen mit Mammakarzinom im Stadium T1–2 N1, die eine standardmäßige adjuvante Systemtherapie erhielten. Es gibt aber Hinweise auf eine Verbesserung des lokoregionalen rezidivfreien Überlebens mit PMRT. Diese Ergebnisse bedürfen jedoch einer prospektiven Evaluierung.

Introduction
Following breast-conserving surgery, adjuvant radiotherapy is a standard evidence-based practice in almost all patients [1]. On the other hand, following mastectomy, adjuvant radiotherapy was recommended for patients with a higher risk of locoregional recurrence (including > T2 stage, >4 positive lymph nodes, or positive margins; [2]).
For patients with T1–2, N1 disease, the indication for postmastectomy radiotherapy (PMRT) is less certain [3, 4]. The majority of the studies showing potential beneﬁt for this subset of patients were either retrospective in nature with numerous confounding factors or old prospective trials that were conducted in an era where standard adjuvant systemic therapy was not yet fully evolved [5, 6]. Given the observation that systemic therapy is an important determinant for the risk of locoregional relapse and thus for the potential beneﬁt from adjuvant radiotherapy [1], there is a pressing need to prospectively reassess the real beneﬁt of adjuvant radiotherapy in this subset of patients in the context of currently approved standard adjuvant systemic therapy.
The recently launched collaborative project (Project Data Sphere, PDS) allows access to the raw data of a number of

practice-changing oncology trials [7]. Among the available trials in this project, there are a number of phase III trials evaluating adjuvant chemotherapy regimens for operable breast cancer. It was thus thought that assessment of the outcomes of PMRT for T1–2N1 breast cancer patients enrolled into these studies would provide an insight into the outcomes of this subset of patients in the context of effective, currently accepted adjuvant systemic therapy regimens.
Proper evaluation of the potential beneﬁt from adjuvant radiotherapy in this setting should inform practice for this very common disease.
Objective
To assess the impact of PMRT on overall survival, relapsefree survival, and locoregional control among breast cancer patients with T1–2N1M0 disease who received standard adjuvant chemotherapy.

Methodology

Data collection

Description of the study cohort
The current analysis is based on an individual patient data analysis of three phase III trials evaluating different adjuvant chemotherapy regimens for breast cancer. These three trials were chosen on the basis of availability of raw data within the PDS initiative as well as regarding the suitability of these trials to answer the primary research question. After appropriate approvals and through the PDS initiative, the data were downloaded. The three trials are NCT00174655 (BIG 02/98), NCT00688740 (BCIRG001), and NCT00312208 (BCIRG005; only the datasets of control arms were available for the three studies). The primary results of these trials were analyzed and have been published previously [8–10]. Table 1 summarized details of each of these trials. Overall, a total of 3390 patients were available from the combined dataset. Out of this combined dataset, 1053 patients with T1–T2 N1 disease who were treated with mastectomy and have complete information about radiotherapy and survival were further selected in the study cohort. Fig. 1 describes the selection process of the sub-cohort of the current study.

The following information was obtained from each of the included datasets; age at diagnosis; body mass index, race, performance score, lymph node ratio (number of positive lymph nodes to number of examined lymph nodes), pathological T and N stage, grade, hormone receptor status (estrogen and progesterone receptors), Her2 neu status, histological subtype, whether or not adjuvant radiotherapy was administered, protocol of adjuvant chemotherapy, overall survival, vital status, relapse status, and relapse-free survival. Events of locoregional recurrence were also sought and deﬁned as any event of ipsilateral local or regional recurrence.
In accordance with the available protocol of the included trials, all included patients have adequate organ function (including cardiac, hepatic, renal, and bone marrow functions) and all patients have good performance status. Overall survival was deﬁned in the current analysis as “time from randomization till death” (patients were censored if they were alive at the time of database lock for each study). Relapse-free survival was deﬁned as “time from randomization till local, regional, or distant relapse” (patients were censored if they were alive at the time of database lock or if they died without relapse). Locoregional relapse-free survival was deﬁned as “time from randomization till local or regional relapse” (patients were censored if they were alive at the time of database lock or if they died without locoregional relapse).

for the three endpoints (overall, relapse-free, and locoregional relapse-free).
Although patients within this analysis were derived from randomized studies, those patients were not randomized for the endpoint of assessing the impact of PMRT. Unbalanced baseline characteristics could have thus led to some sort of selection bias and, accordingly, this might have inﬂuenced the decision to administer PMRT. The propensity score matching approach was thus additionally employed in this analysis in order to account for this potential limitation [11]. It is deﬁned in this analysis as the probability of being assigned to PMRT or no PMRT groups given the baseline characteristics. In the calculation of the propensity scores, the following baseline covariates were considered in the logistic regression model: age at diagnosis, T stage, grade, hormone receptor status, and type of chemotherapy administered. These factors were chosen on the basis of their known prognostic relevance for the outcomes of early breast cancer patients. Number of matches per observation was established at 1.
A two-tailed P-value < 0.05 was counted as statistically signiﬁcant. Statistical analyses were evaluated using SPSS Statistics 20.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA) and STATA software 14.0 (STATAcorp, TX, USA).

1053 patients were included into final analysis

Statistical considerations
Baseline characteristics of included patients were detailed through descriptive statistics and chi-squared testing was used to differentiate baseline characteristics of patients who received versus those who did not receive adjuvant radiotherapy. The probability of overall survival was assessed according to whether or not patients received adjuvant radiotherapy through Kaplan–Meier analysis and log-rank testing.
Univariate and multivariate analyses of predictors of overall, relapse-free, and locoregional relapse-free survival were conducted through Cox regression analysis. The following variables were examined for their potential impact on overall and relapse-free survival: age, menopause, T stage, lymph node ratio, hormone-receptor status, adjuvant radiotherapy, and chemotherapy protocol. Variables with a statistically signiﬁcant P-value (P < 0.05) in the univariate analysis were included in the multivariate analysis. Proportional hazard assumption was assessed graphically

Results
Most patients have an age in the range of 40–69 years (85.8%) and Caucasian race represents the majority of cases with known race (53.5%). The majority of the patients have a T2 stage (59.8%), ductal carcinoma histology (81.5%), and hormone receptor-positive disease (71.4%). Only a minor percentage of patients have a G3 disease (35.5%). Premenopausal patients represent 51.9% of the study cohort. All patients were treated with mastectomy and adjuvant chemotherapy. 53.9% of patients received adjuvant radiotherapy while 46.1% did not receive adjuvant radiotherapy. Median number of resected lymph nodes is 10 lymph nodes (range: 2–46). 750 patients (71.2%) have complete phenotype information (hormone receptor and Her2 status). Among those 750 patients, 508 patients have hormone receptor +ve/Her2 –ve disease, 144 patients have triple negative disease, 44 patients have hormone receptor –ve/Her2 +ve disease, and 54 patients have hormone receptor +ve/Her2 +ve disease. In the majority of patients who received adjuvant radiotherapy, this was conventionally fractionated (1.8–2 Gy/fraction; 25 fractions). Among patients who received PMRT, 397 patients (69.8%) received supraclavicular (± axillary) radiotherapy and 113 patients (19.8%) received internal mammary radiotherapy. All patients with known margin status (634 patients) have negative margins. Additional systemic therapies (e.g., endocrine

Comparing patients who received versus those who did not receive adjuvant radiotherapy, there was no difference in age (P = 0.223), performance status (P = 0.376), menopausal status (P = 0.538), T stage (P = 0.983), body mass index (P = 0.176), or hormone receptor status (P = 0.719). On the other hand, there was signiﬁcant difference in race (more Caucasian patients receive PMRT; P < 0.0001), lymph node ratio (higher ratio in patients receiving radiotherapy; P < 0.0001), and histological subtype (more ductal carcinoma patients receive PMRT; P = 0.003). Locoregional relapse rates were 5.6% (32 patients) among patients who received adjuvant radiotherapy vs. 6.6% (32 patients) among patients who did not receive adjuvant radiotherapy. Actuarial 5 and 10-year locoregional relapse-free survival rates were 94 and 93%, respectively, among patients who did not receive adjuvant radiotherapy versus 95 and 92% among patients who received adjuvant radiotherapy. Table 2 provides details of baseline characteristics in both groups of patients. Median follow up for the entire cohort: 116 months (range: 1.37–148).

Kaplan–Meier analysis of overall survival according to PMRT was conducted. Apparently, patients who did not receive PMRT seem to have better overall survival (P = 0.042; Fig. 2).

ducted for different phenotypic subsets of patients. PMRT did not affect overall survival among all subtypes of breast cancer (triple negative, luminal, and Her2 over-expressed subtypes; data not shown).
Additional treatment effect estimation (for overall survival) through propensity score matching was conducted incorporating the following factors besides PMRT: age at diagnosis, T stage, hormone receptor status, grade, and type of chemotherapy administered. According to this additional analysis, PMRT did not affect the risk of death compared to no PMRT (coefﬁcient: 0.018; 95% CI: –0.07 to 0.106; P = 0.688).
In univariate Cox regression analysis, the following factors were signiﬁcant for overall survival (P < 0.05): age, T stage, lymph node ratio, hormone receptor status, and adjuvant radiotherapy.

Adjuvant radiotherapy was, however, not associated with better relapse-free survival in the multivariate analysis (P = 0.970). The above multivariate analysis was repeated after including an interaction between surgery to chemotherapy interval and hormone receptor status, and this did not show any beneﬁt for adjuvant radiotherapy either (P = 0.989).
The impact of adjuvant radiotherapy on locoregional relapse-free survival was further assessed in a multivariate Cox regression analysis incorporating age, T stage, lymph node ratio, hormone receptor status, and chemotherapy protocol (i.e., the factors which were signiﬁcant for relapsefree survival in univariate analysis). In this multivariate analysis, the following factors were predictive of shorter locoregional relapse-free survival: age Ä 40 (P < 0.0001), no PMRT (P = 0.034), FAC chemotherapy (P = 0.001), and higher T stage (P = 0.002; Table 5).

Discussion
The current study provides an assessment of the impact of PMRT on the outcomes of patients with T1–T2 N1 disease treated with standard adjuvant systemic therapy. It suggested that—within the context of standard adjuvant systemic therapy—administration of adjuvant radiotherapy does not seem to improve overall or relapse-free survival. There is, however, evidence of improvement in locoregional relapse-free survival with PMRT. This indication needs to be thoroughly reconsidered and this ﬁnding needs to be prospectively validated.
The current analysis is not in line with a previous retrospective study suggesting better outcomes of patients with T1–T2 N1 disease treated with PMRT [12]. However, the current analysis is methodologically different, given that it includes a pooled analysis of individual patient data across a number of controlled clinical trials with sufﬁcient followup (compared to previous retrospective studies).
The current analysis is not in line with the previously published Danish Breast Cancer Cooperative Group 82b and 82c trials (which showed that the addition of PMRT

K

prolongs survival) [13, 14]. However, the patient population is different in both trials compared to the current analysis (in both Danish studies, a considerable proportion of patients have T3/4 and/or N2/3 disease). Although a subsequent subgroup analysis of the two Danish studies suggested that the beneﬁt for patients with N1 disease is similar to the beneﬁt for patients with N2–3 disease, the patient population in this subgroup analysis received suboptimal systemic therapy by current standards (CMF for premenopausal women and 1 year of tamoxifen for postmenopausal women) [15]. Thus, these results cannot be compared to the results of the current analysis where patients received full-course standard adjuvant systemic therapy. Consistent with this assumption is the observation that the absolute risk reduction of locoregional relapse for N1 patients (because of adjuvant radiotherapy) in the subgroup analysis of the two Danish studies was 20% vs. only 1.3% in the current analysis. This conﬁrms the hypothesis that more effective adjuvant systemic therapy in the current analysis decreased the probability of locoregional relapse and thus minimized the potential beneﬁt of adjuvant radiotherapy.
Similarly, there are differences between the current analysis and the previously published British Columbia study which suggested a morality beneﬁt for PMRT [5]. The study population of the British Columbia study incorporated T1–4 N1–3 patients. Moreover, the study was conducted from 1979 to 1986, which casts doubt about the efﬁcacy of adjuvant systemic therapy used for those patients.
Likewise, the results of the current study are not in line with the previously published Early Breast Cancer Trialists’ Collaborative Group (EBCTCG) analysis which showed that PMRT reduces breast cancer mortality among women with one to three positive axillary lymph nodes [6]. However, it has to be noted that patients in this pooled analysis were treated between 1964 and 1986, where adjuvant systemic therapy protocols were not standardized and cannot be compared to the standard systemic therapy regimens used in the current analysis. Moreover, patients in the EBCTCG pooled analysis have T1–4 disease (not T1–2 disease like in the current analysis). Additionally, hormone receptor status was not known in a considerable proportion of the patients in the EBCTCG analysis.
The current study has, however, some limitations and these need to be acknowledged. Data about additional factors which might contribute to the risk of locoregional recurrence following mastectomy (e.g., lymphovascular space invasion) [16] were not adequately covered in the pooled data of these trials. Moreover, full details about the volume and fractionation of radiation therapy are not provided (given that the primary focus of all of the included studies was on the systemic therapy used). Additionally, the current analysis is a secondary analysis and not the primary research question of the three studies (i.e., patients were

not randomized between PMRT and no PMRT). This might be a source of confounding and for this purpose, multivariate Cox regression analysis as well as propensity score matching were employed to account for this potential confounding. Another limitation in the current analysis might be the lack of information about smoking in the majority of patients (which has been shown in a recent study to increase the risk of relapse of breast cancer) [17].
It must also be noted that all patients included in the current analysis received adjuvant anthracycline-based chemotherapy. Thus, the results of the current study cannot be extended to T1–2N1 patients who are planned for adjuvant endocrine therapy alone. Additional studies are needed to elucidate the role of PMRT among those patients.
The median number of resected lymph nodes is 10 (range: 2–46) in the current study. It is not clear from the available protocols/datasets of included studies if some patients were treated with sentinel lymph node biopsy or not. This is a potential confounder that should be taken into consideration when interpreting the results of the current analysis.
In order to interpret properly the overall lower rates of locoregional recurrences in the current analysis (compared to previous prospective studies), additional factors (other than improved systemic therapy) might be considered. These include more optimal surgical procedures which might have contributed to lower rates of subsequent locoregional relapses.
Consistent with previous retrospective studies, younger age, T2 stage, hormone receptor-negative status, and higher lymph node ratio may be associated with a higher risk of relapse and mortality [18, 19]. However, the current analysis suggested that PMRT might not be the optimal way to tackle that increasing risk. The data from this analysis should be viewed as hypothesis generating but need to be conﬁrmed by future phase III trials.
Recently, a subset analysis of the BIG 02-98 study was published evaluating a similar question to the one posed by the current study [20]. However, this study incorporated all mastectomy-treated patients included in BIG 2-98 study (both experimental and comparator arms). The PDS datasets from which the current analysis was derived include only patients in the comparator arms. Thus, the results of the two studies cannot be compared.
Interestingly, PMRT was associated with worse overall survival in Kaplan–Meier analysis. However, this ﬁnding was not replicated in multivariate Cox regression analysis. This indicates that worse outcomes among radiotherapytreated patients might be related to adverse clinicopathological characteristics rather than radiotherapy itself.
In conclusion, the current analysis does not suggest a beneﬁcial impact for PMRT on overall or relapse-free survival among patients with T1–T2 N1 disease who re-

ceived standard adjuvant systemic therapy. There is, however, evidence of improvement in locoregional relapsefree survival with PMRT. The study additionally provides evidence that the frequency of locoregional recurrence after mastectomy is considerably low in this good prognostic subset of patients treated with contemporary systemic therapies. Further prospective validation of these ﬁndings needs to be performed. The indications for PMRT need to be thoroughly reassessed in the context of currently available standard adjuvant systemic therapy.
