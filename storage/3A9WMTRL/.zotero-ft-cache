Breast Cancer, Version 4.2021

Overview
Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer globally and continues to be second only to lung cancer as a cause of cancer death.1 The American Cancer Society estimates that 284, 200 Americans will be diagnosed with breast cancer and 44, 130 will die of the disease in the United States in 2021.2 The therapeutic options for patients with noninvasive or invasive breast cancer are complex and varied. The NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines) for Breast Cancer include up-to-date guidelines for the clinical management of patients with carcinoma in situ, invasive breast cancer, Paget disease, phyllodes tumor, inÔ¨Çammatory breast cancer, male breast cancer, and breast cancer during pregnancy. These guidelines are developed by a multidisciplinary panel of representatives from NCCN Member Institutions with breast cancer‚Äìfocused expertise in the Ô¨Åelds of medical oncology, surgical oncology, radiation oncology, pathology, reconstructive surgery, and patient advocacy.
In the 2021 version of the NCCN Guidelines for Breast Cancer, the panel included updated recommendations for axillary staging; adjuvant radiation therapy; adjuvant systemic therapy for patients with

hormone receptor‚Äìpositive (HR1) and HER2-negative (HER22) breast cancer; and systemic therapy for metastatic disease. This report summarizes the rationale behind the recommendations speciÔ¨Åc to adjuvant systemic therapy for patients with nonmetastatic early-stage HR1/HER22 breast cancer.
Adjuvant Systemic Therapy
In patients with early-stage breast cancer, systemic adjuvant therapy is administered to reduce risk of breast cancer recurrence. The decision is often based on individual risk of relapse and predicted sensitivity to treatment (eg, estrogen and progesterone receptors and HER2 status). The decision to use systemic adjuvant therapy requires consideration and balancing of risk for disease recurrence with local therapy alone, the magnitude of beneÔ¨Åt from applying adjuvant therapy, toxicity of the therapy, and comorbidity. The decision-making process requires collaboration between the healthcare team and the patient.
Pathologic T1‚Äì3 HR1/HER22 Tumors Patients with HR1/HER22 tumors receive adjuvant endocrine therapy to reduce the risk of recurrence. Those deemed at high risk for distant recurrence despite

adjuvant endocrine therapy may also receive adjuvant chemotherapy. The decision whether to administer adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with HR1/HER22 tumors is based on many factors, including lymph node (LN) status, tumor size, patient age, comorbid conditions, and risk assessment based on results of a validated gene expression assay.
Among patients with pathologic T1‚Äì3 (pT1‚Äì3) HR1/ HER22 tumors, on one end of the spectrum are those with small (pT1mi and T1a) and node-negative (pN0) tumors. These patients with small tumors up to 0.5 cm in greatest diameter that do not involve the LNs have low clinical risk of recurrence and a favorable prognosis. The incremental beneÔ¨Åt of adding adjuvant chemotherapy to endocrine therapy in patients with such tumors is minimal.3 On the other end of the spectrum are patients with high-risk features, such as !4 positive LNs. In this group, the addition of systemic chemotherapy to adjuvant endocrine therapy may play a role in reducing recurrence risk.
For patients in whom the decision whether to use chemotherapy is unclear, gene expression assays may be used to assess recurrence risk. The primary role of the gene expression assays is to determine clinical situations

that warrant addition of chemotherapy to endocrine therapy to further reduce recurrence risk.
The 21-gene assay (Oncotype Dx), which determines recurrence risk using a recurrence score (RS), is one of the most validated multigene assays. The RS is helpful in determining the prognosis in patients with HR1/HER22 tumors treated with endocrine therapy alone by predicting locoregional and distant recurrence.4‚Äì6 This assay has also been validated to predict the beneÔ¨Åt from adding adjuvant chemotherapy to adjuvant endocrine therapy for patients with HR1/HER22 breast cancer.7‚Äì10
The TAILORx study evaluated outcomes in patients (n59,719) with HR1/HER22 axillary LN-negative breast cancer.10 At 9 years, among patients (n51,619) with low RS ( 10), all of whom received endocrine therapy alone without chemotherapy, the rate of freedom from recurrence of breast cancer at local/regional or distant site was 96.8% and the rate of invasive disease-free survival (DFS) was 84%. Among patients (n51,389) with a high RS (!26), all of whom received chemotherapy, the rate of freedom from recurrence of breast cancer at local/regional or distant site was 84.8% and of invasive DFS was 75.7%.10 The overall results from TAILORx are similar to those

from the West German Study Group Plan B trial11 and NSABP B-20 trial8 for patients with low RS and high RS. The NSABP B-20 was the Ô¨Årst trial to validate the 21-gene assay as both a prognostic and a predictive tool and identiÔ¨Åed RS cutoffs to predict the magnitude of chemotherapy beneÔ¨Åt in patients with node-negative, HR1 breast cancer.8 It is important to remember that the cutoff for low, intermediate, and high RS was different in TAILORx versus NSABP B-20.
Among patients (n56,711) with intermediate RS (11‚Äì25) in the TAILORx trial, outcomes were similar between the group that received adjuvant chemotherapy followed by endocrine therapy versus endocrine therapy alone. At 9 years, the rate of freedom from recurrence of breast cancer at distant site was 95% for those who received adjuvant chemotherapy followed by endocrine therapy versus 94.5% for those who received endocrine therapy alone; invasive DFS rates were 83.3% versus 84.3, and overall survival (OS) rates were 93.8% versus 93.9%.10 In an exploratory subset analysis of the TAILORx trial, among patients aged 50 years, with an RS of 0 to 15, and receiving endocrine therapy alone, the rate of distant recurrence was 3% at 9 years. However, those with an RS of

16 to 25 had signiÔ¨Åcantly lower rates of distance recurrence with the addition of adjuvant chemotherapy to endocrine therapy.10 At 9 years, among patients with an RS of 16 to 20, the absolute difference was 3.4% lower rates of local and distant recurrences, 9% reduction in invasive DFS, and 1.6% reduction in distant recurrence in those receiving chemotherapy plus endocrine therapy. In the group with an RS of 21 to 25, the absolute difference was 8.7% lower rates of local and distant recurrence and 6.6% reduction in distant recurrence in those receiving chemotherapy in addition to endocrine therapy.10 No beneÔ¨Åt of chemotherapy was observed among patients aged .50 years or in the overall population. The TAILORx study did not collect data on chemotherapy-induced menopause and only 12.5% of the premenopausal patients enrolled in the trial underwent ovarian suppression.10 A much discussed hypothesis is that chemotherapy effect may have been the result of ovarian suppression.
Results of the TAILORx trial in patients with low-risk, node-negative disease were similar to those of the MINDACT trial.12 In the MINDACT trial, patients were stratiÔ¨Åed into clinical high- or low-risk categories using the Adjuvant! Online criteria and genomic high- or low-risk

categories by 70-gene assay (MammaPrint). Clinical lowrisk was deÔ¨Åned as low histologic grade and tumor size
3 cm, intermediate histologic grade and tumor size 2 cm, or high histologic grade and tumor size 1 cm, and clinical high-risk was deÔ¨Åned as all other cases with known values for grade and tumor size. Patients with clinical-high/genomic-low risk were randomized to receive chemotherapy in addition to endocrine therapy or to endocrine therapy alone. At 8 years, the distant metastasis‚Äìfree survival rates were 92.0% (95% CI, 89.6‚Äì93.8) versus 89.4% (95% CI, 86.8‚Äì91.5), respectively.12 The OS at 8 years was 95.7% (95% CI, 93.9‚Äì97.0) for those receiving chemotherapy plus endocrine therapy versus 94.3% (95% CI, 92.2‚Äì95.8) for those receiving endocrine therapy alone.12 In a subset analyses, the beneÔ¨Åt of chemotherapy was mostly seen in patients aged ,50 years. The absolute difference in distant metastasis‚Äìfree survival at 8 years in those receiving chemotherapy was 5.4% ¬± 2.8% for patients aged 50 years versus 0.2% ¬± 2.3% for those aged .50 years.13 It is not known whether the beneÔ¨Åt of chemotherapy observed in premenopausal patients, in both the TAILORx and MINDACT trials, is related to chemotherapy-induced ovarian function suppression.

The RxPONDER study randomized patients (n55,083) with HR1, pN1 (1‚Äì3 positive LNs) disease and RS 25 to receive adjuvant chemotherapy plus endocrine therapy or endocrine therapy alone.14 In the overall study population, 66.8% of patients were postmenopausal and 33.2% premenopausal; 10.3% had high-grade disease; 9.2% had 3 involved nodes; and 62.6% received complete axillary node dissection and 37.4% received sentinel LN dissection. Chemotherapy and RS were both independently prognostic for invasive DFS. There was no interaction seen between RS and chemotherapy. The beneÔ¨Åt for chemotherapy in the overall randomized cohort was 1.4% at 5 years.14
In a planned secondary analysis, a correlation was seen between chemotherapy beneÔ¨Åt and menopausal status. In postmenopausal patients with RS 25 and pN1 (1‚Äì3 positive LNs) disease, the 5-year invasive DFS rate was 91.6% with adjuvant chemotherapy in addition to adjuvant endocrine therapy versus 91.9% with endocrine therapy alone (hazard ratio [HR], 0.97; 95% CI, 0.78‚Äì1.22), indicating no beneÔ¨Åt from chemotherapy.14 In the premenopausal patients with RS 25, the addition of adjuvant systemic chemotherapy improved outcomes. There was a 5.2% increase in invasive DFS with the addition of

chemotherapy to endocrine therapy (HR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.38‚Äì0.76),14 and an absolute decrease in distant recurrence by 2.9% with chemotherapy. The 5-year OS was 1.3% better in chemotherapy-treated premenopausal patients (97.3 vs 98.6%; 95% CI, 0.24‚Äì0.94).14 When further analyzed according to RS, the premenopausal patients with an RS of 0 to 13 received less absolute beneÔ¨Åt from chemotherapy (3.9% reduction in invasive DFS) compared with those with an RS of 14 to 25 (6.2% reduction in invasive DFS). Approximately 16% of patients receiving endocrine therapy alone received ovarian suppression, compared with 4% in the chemotherapy/endocrine therapy arm.14 However, it is also important to note that it is not clear whether the beneÔ¨Åt seen in premenopausal patients is related to chemotherapy-induced ovarian function suppression.
Gene Expression Assays In addition to the 21-gene assay and the 70-gene assay (MammaPrint), other gene expression assays can also provide prognostic information on outcomes with endocrine treatment, such as the 50-gene assay (Prosigna), 12gene assay (EndoPredict), and Breast Cancer Index (BCI; HOXB13/IL17BR ratio [H/I]). None of these assays have been compared head-to-head in randomized trials and,

except for the 21-gene assay, no others have been validated to predict the beneÔ¨Åt from adding adjuvant chemotherapy to adjuvant endocrine therapy in patients with early-stage HR1/HER22 disease.
Use of gene expression assays in early-stage breast cancer continues to evolve. The clinical utility of the BCI assay was studied in the prospective phase III IDEAL trial, which randomized postmenopausal patients (n51,824) with early-stage HR1 breast cancer to receive either 2.5 or 5 years of letrozole after completing 5 years of adjuvant endocrine therapy.15 Patients with BCI (H/I) low demonstrated a lower risk of distant recurrence (compared with BCI [H/I] high) and no signiÔ¨Åcant improvement in DFS or OS compared with the control arm with extended endocrine therapy duration.16 Patients with T1, HR1/HER22, pN0 tumors with BCI (H/I) high (5.1‚Äì10) demonstrated signiÔ¨Åcant rates of late distant recurrence. In contrast, patients with BCI (H/I) low derived no beneÔ¨Åt from extended adjuvant therapy.16 These data are similar to those seen in secondary analyses of the MA.17 and Trans-aTTom studies, in which patients with HR1, T1‚Äì3, pN0 or pN1 tumors with BCI (H/I) high demonstrated signiÔ¨Åcant improvements in DFS when adjuvant endocrine therapy was extended, compared with the control arm.17,18

NCCN Recommendations: pT1‚Äì3 HR1/HER22 Tumors
Patients With Tumors 0.5 cm and LN-Negative The panel does not recommend adjuvant systemic chemotherapy in premenopausal or postmenopausal patients with tumors 0.5 cm and pN0. Adjuvant endocrine therapy alone is an option to reduce the recurrence risk. Because the beneÔ¨Åt of adjuvant endocrine therapy in reducing the recurrence risk, particularly distant metastatic disease, is very small in this group of patients, this is a category 2B recommendation (see BINV-6 and BINV-7, pages 486 and 487, respectively).
Patients With !4 Positive LNs Considering the high risk of recurrence in patients with pN2/pN3 tumors, regardless of menopausal status, the panel recommends addition of systemic adjuvant chemotherapy followed by endocrine therapy (category 1) (see BINV-6 and BINV-8, pages 486 and 488, respectively).
Patients With Tumors .0.5 cm or pN1mi or pN1 (1‚Äì3 Positive LNs) For HR1/HER22 tumors that fall between the 2 previous extremes (.0.5 cm or either pN1mi or pN1 with 1‚Äì3

positive LNs), the panel has additionally stratiÔ¨Åed the recommendations based on menopausal status and risk assessment based on gene expression assay results. Of note, patients with pNmi disease were not studied in either the TAILORx or the RxPONDER trials.
Results from TAILORx and RxPONDER show that the 21-gene assay RS is helpful in identifying patients who can be spared adjuvant chemotherapy, especially those who are postmenopausal (or with stage pN0 and age .50 years) and have an RS 25, as well as patients aged 50 years with an RS 15. If a patient is a candidate for chemotherapy based on clinical characteristics, tumor stage, and pathology with a tumor .0.5 cm or with 1 to 3 involved LNs, and a multigene assay is not available or not performed to assess recurrence risk, the panel recommends systemic adjuvant chemotherapy followed by endocrine therapy (category 1). Patients who are not candidates for chemotherapy, including those with contraindications to chemotherapy or who do not wish to undergo chemotherapy treatment, gene expression assay results would not alter management, and therefore such patients may be treated with endocrine therapy alone with the consideration of ovarian ablation/suppression, if premenopausal.

Breast Cancer, Version 4.2021

For postmenopausal patients with tumors .0.5 cm or 1 to 3 positive LNs, the panel strongly recommends considering the 21-gene RT-PCR assay to help estimate likelihood of recurrence and beneÔ¨Åt from chemotherapy (category 1) (see BINV-6, page 486). The panel notes that although several other prognostic assays are available to estimate recurrence risk, only the 21-gene assay RS has been validated for predicting the beneÔ¨Åt of adding adjuvant chemotherapy to further reduce the recurrence risk. Results of the RxPONDER trial show that postmenopausal patients with 1 to 3 positive LNs might not have a risk as high as previously assumed. Therefore, taking together the results of the RxPONDER and TAILORx trials, endocrine therapy alone is recommended for those with RS ,26,14,19 and based on the results of the TAILORx study, addition of adjuvant chemotherapy to adjuvant endocrine therapy is recommended for those with RS !26.7,8
For premenopausal patients, the recommendations are further stratiÔ¨Åed based on nodal status. The TAILORx analyses were performed by age and demonstrated that patients with RS !16 and aged 50 years with nodenegative disease derived beneÔ¨Åt from chemotherapy (reduction in distant recurrence) at 9 years.19 Based on

this, the NCCN panel strongly recommends considering the 21-gene RT-PCR assay to help estimate likelihood of recurrence and beneÔ¨Åt from chemotherapy (category 1) (see BINV-7, page 487). In those with RS 15, the NCCN panel recommends considering endocrine therapy alone.19 Also, patients with T1b tumors with lowgrade histology should be considered for endocrine monotherapy, given that the TAILORx19 did not include patients with such tumors.
Based on the exploratory analysis from the TAILORx study, which showed beneÔ¨Åt of adjuvant chemotherapy in patients aged 50 years with an RS of 16 to 25, the panel recommends the addition of chemotherapy to adjuvant endocrine therapy or adjuvant endocrine therapy alone with or without consideration of ovarian ablation/suppression.19 Because the TAILORx study did not collect data on chemotherapy-induced menopause and only a small portion (12.5%) of the patients on the trial underwent ovarian suppression, it remains unclear whether similar beneÔ¨Åts could be achieved with ovarian suppression plus endocrine therapy instead of chemotherapy20 (see BINV-7, page 487).
No randomized trial has addressed the beneÔ¨Åt of chemotherapy for those with high RS (26‚Äì100) among

492

premenopausal patients with early stage, node-positive disease. Because the beneÔ¨Åt of adjuvant chemotherapy for those with RS 25 is signiÔ¨Åcant in the RxPONDER trial, it can be inferred that the beneÔ¨Åt for those with RS !26 would be substantial.14
The RxPONDER results demonstrated premenopausal patients with early-stage pN1 disease and an RS of 0 to 25 derived beneÔ¨Åt from chemotherapy14 For patients with pN1mi ( 2 mm axillary node metastases) or pN1 (1‚Äì3 positive LNs) disease, the panel recommends assessing whether the patient is a candidate for chemotherapy based on patient factors and tumor characteristics before mandating adjuvant chemotherapy in all patients with 1 to 3 positive nodes. The decision regarding the addition of chemotherapy versus ovarian function suppression to adjuvant endocrine therapy must be individualized, and can be aided by results of gene expression assays. At this time, it is unclear whether ovarian suppression plus endocrine therapy alone will provide the same beneÔ¨Åts as addition of chemotherapy. According to the panel, either addition of adjuvant chemotherapy to adjuvant endocrine therapy based on the RxPONDER results14 or adjuvant endocrine

therapy with ovarian ablation/suppression20 are options for this group.
The panel has provided a list of available assays along with their treatment implications in a table on BINV-N (pages 489‚Äì493). The table was revised to include updated references for the 21-gene and BCI assays.
Summary
The updated recommendations in the NCCN Guidelines for Breast Cancer provide guidance on tailoring chemotherapy recommendations for patients with HR1/HER22 early-stage breast cancer based on clinicopathologic characteristics, menopausal status, LN status, and results of gene expression assays. Use of gene expression assays in early-stage breast cancer continues to evolve. Risk assessment using the BCI gene expression assay has also shown potential to spare certain patients from prolonged endocrine therapy.
