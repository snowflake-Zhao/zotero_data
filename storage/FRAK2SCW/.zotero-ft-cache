Debulking is a partial or total removal of the tumor mass and can involve the removal of multiple organ sites. It may include removal of ovaries and/or the uterus (a hysterectomy). The pathology report may or may not identify ovarian tissue. A debulking is usually followed by another treatment modality such as chemotherapy. [SEER Note: Debulking or cytoreductive surgery is implied by the following phrases in the operative report,
pathology report, discharge summary, or consultation. (This is not intended to be a complete list. Other phrases may also imply debulking).
Adjuvant treatment pending surgical reduction of tumor Ovaries, tubes buried in tumor Tumor burden Tumor cakes Very large tumor mass
Do not code debulking or cytoreductive surgery based on: multiple biopsies alone, the mention of “multiple tissue fragments” or “removal of multiple implants.” Multiple biopsies and multiple specimens confirm the presence or absence of metastasis.]
