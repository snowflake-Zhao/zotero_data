Summary
Background The role of locoregional treatment in women with metastatic breast cancer at ﬁrst presentation is unclear. Preclinical evidence suggests that such treatment might help the growth of metastatic disease, whereas many retrospective analyses in clinical cohorts have suggested a favourable eﬀect of locoregional treatment in these patients. We aimed to compare the eﬀect of locoregional treatment with no treatment on outcome in women with metastatic breast cancer at initial presentation.
Methods In this open-label, randomised controlled trial, we recruited previously untreated patients (≤65 years of age with an estimated remaining life expectancy of at least 1 year) presenting with de-novo metastatic breast cancer from Tata Memorial Centre, Mumbai, India. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive locoregional treatment directed at their primary breast tumour and axillary lymph nodes, or no locoregional treatment, by a computergenerated block randomisation sequence (block size of four). Randomisation was stratiﬁed by site of distant metastases, number of metastatic lesions, and hormone receptor status. Patients with resectable primary tumour in the breast that could be treated with endocrine therapy were randomly assigned upfront, whereas those with an unresectable primary tumour were planned for chemotherapy before randomisation. Of the patients who had chemotherapy before randomisation, we randomly assigned patients who had an objective tumour response after six to eight cycles of chemotherapy. The primary endpoint was overall survival analysed by intention to treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00193778.
Findings Between Feb 7, 2005, and Jan 18, 2013, of the 716 women presenting with de-novo metastatic breast cancer, we randomly assigned 350 patients: 173 to locoregional treatment and 177 to no locoregional treatment. At data cut-oﬀ of Nov 1, 2013, median follow-up was 23 months (IQR 12·2–38·7) with 235 deaths (locoregional treatment n=118, no locoregional treatment n=117). Median overall survival was 19·2 months (95% CI 15·98–22·46) in the locoregional treatment group and 20·5 months (16·96–23·98) in the no-locoregional treatment group (HR 1·04, 95% CI 0·81–1·34; p=0·79), and the corresponding 2-year overall survival was 41·9% (95% CI 33·9–49·7) in the locoregional treatment group and 43·0% (35·2–50·8) in the no locoregional treatment group. The only adverse event noted was wound infection related to surgery in one patient in the locoregional treatment group.

Interpretation There is no evidence to suggest that locoregional treatment of the primary tumour aﬀects overall survival in patients with metastatic breast cancer at initial presentation who have responded to front-line chemotherapy, and this procedure should not be part of routine practice.

Introduction
Metastatic breast cancer is deemed an incurable disease with the main goals of treatment being prolongation of survival and palliation of symptoms. About 3–8% of patients with newly diagnosed disease have distant metastases at initial presentation.1 The mainstay of treatment is systemic therapy, which includes chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, and targeted drugs. Traditionally, locoregional treatment (surgery or radiation) has been used only for control of fungation and bleeding.
Data from experiments in animal models of diﬀerent cancers have suggested that surgical removal of the primary tumour could potentially increase metastatic spread.2–5 By contrast, removal of the primary tumour

was shown to improve survival in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma.6,7 Removal of the primary tumour could potentially improve the outcome in breast cancer by removing drug resistant clones of cancer cells. Our trial was motivated by several retrospective analyses8–20 that reported an overall survival beneﬁt of locoregional treatment in patients with metastatic breast cancer. However, these studies are disparate in terms of patient numbers, indications for surgery, timing of surgery, and type of surgical intervention. Therefore, their results were probably aﬀected by selection bias and a limited ability to control for potential confounding factors. Other retrospective analyses that have attempted to control for these biases have not shown any survival advantage after locoregional treatment.21–25 A recent meta-analysis of

Panel: Research in context
Evidence before the study To identify other studies of locoregional treatment of the primary tumour in patients with metastatic breast cancer we did a detailed search, with no time restriction, in PubMed and congress abstracts of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, European Society of Medical Oncology, and San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium. We used the search terms “locoregional”, “surgery”, “metastatic”, and “breast”, and restricted our search to English language reports and publications. Our search identiﬁed several non-randomised, non-controlled, mainly retrospective studies, and few meta-analyses of these studies. There was no randomised controlled trial published in a peer-reviewed journal and only one randomised trial presented at a conference. The retrospective data suggested an overall survival beneﬁt for patients treated with surgery, with or without radiation, for the primary breast tumour. However, these studies had several biases. The randomised trial presented

as an abstract did not show superiority of surgical treatment of the primary tumour compared with no surgical treatment in these patients.
Added value of the study For patients with de-novo metastatic breast cancer, our study is the ﬁrst conclusive evidence that locoregional treatment of the primary tumour provides no meaningful survival beneﬁt.
Implications of the available evidence The results of this randomised trial suggest that locoregional treatment should not be a part of standard treatment for the subset of women presenting with de-novo metastatic breast cancer who respond to ﬁrst-line systemic therapy. Our results refute the currently available retrospective evidence of a survival beneﬁt for patients presenting with metastatic breast cancer who are given locoregional treatment for the primary tumour in the presence of distant metastasis.

these studies suggested a signiﬁcantly improved overall survival with surgical resection of the primary tumour.17 However, for the above mentioned reasons, this cannot be deemed deﬁnitive, practice-changing evidence.
To address this uncertainty, we did a randomised controlled trial comparing overall survival after locoregional treatment versus no locoregional treatment in patients with metastatic breast cancer at ﬁrst presentation.
Methods
Study design and participants In this open-label, randomised controlled trial in patients with untreated metastatic breast cancer at initial presentation, we recruited patients from Tata Memorial Centre, Mumbai. At the time of registration, eligible patients had histopathologically conﬁrmed metastatic breast cancer, had not received any previous cancerdirected treatment, were 65 years or younger, and had an estimated life expectancy of at least 1 year. Patients with measurable and non-measureable disease were included. Other eligibility criteria were ﬁtness to receive anthracycline chemotherapy, deﬁned by adequate cardiac and liver functions. Major exclusion criteria at the time of registration were any previous cancer treatment, a single focus of metastatic disease amenable to treatment with curative intent, multiple liver metastases with grossly deranged liver function test, and involvement of more than two visceral organs, because of shorter life expectancy.
We registered patients with resectable hormonesensitive primary breast tumours upfront, whereas those with unresectable primary tumours received chemotherapy ﬁrst and patients with a complete or partial response were registered for the study.
Registered patients were eligible for randomisation if they had an estimated life expectancy of at least 6 months

(at time of randomisation) and were ﬁt to undergo general anaesthesia for major surgery. The major exclusion criterion at the time of randomisation was local or distant progression or stable disease (deﬁned by WHO criteria as less than 50% decrease in tumour volume) in response to the preceding chemotherapy or ulceration, fungation, or bleeding at the local site that mandated palliative locoregional treatment.
The study was done in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the ethical principles of the Good Clinical Practice framework of the International Conference on Harmonisation and was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Tata Memorial Centre. Patients provided written informed consent before being randomly assigned.
Randomisation and masking Eligible patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive locoregional treatment directed at their primary breast tumour and axillary lymph nodes, or no locoregional treatment, with a computer-generated randomisation sequence and a telephone call to the central research oﬃce. RH generated the random sequence. We used a block randomisation method with a block size of four. The stratiﬁcation factors were site of distant metastases (visceral vs bone vs both), number of metastatic lesions (2–3 vs >3), and hormone receptor status (oestrogen or progesterone receptor positive or both vs both negative). The study was periodically monitored for compliance with the protocol and patient safety by the institutional data monitoring and safety subcommittee.
Procedures Patients eligible for upfront randomisation followed by endocrine therapy received tamoxifen 20 mg per day if they were premenopaual and tamoxifen 20 mg per day or

Patients who presented with unresectable primary tumours and who were eligible for systemic treatment received six cycles of anthracycline-based combination chemotherapy (eg, FEC or FAC: 500 mg/m² ﬂuorouracil plus 500 mg/m² cyclophosphamide plus 90–100 mg/m² epirubicin or 50 mg/m² doxorubicin, given every 3 weeks) or eight cycles of a sequential anthracycline-taxane regimen (eg, 90–100 mg/m² epirubicin or 60 mg/m² doxorubicin plus 600 mg/m² cyclophosphamide every 3 weeks for four cycles followed by 175 mg/m² paclitaxel every 3 weeks for four cycles) or six cycles of concurrent anthracycline-taxane chemotherapy (eg, 75 mg/m² docetaxel plus 50 mg/m² doxorubicin plus 500 mg/m² cyclophosphamide), with assessment of response after three or four cycles and after the last cycle of chemotherapy. Response was measured by physical examination. Response was assessed clinically with WHO criteria where tumour regression of greater than or equal to 50% is considered a response. Response in bone lesions was deﬁned as abrogation of symptoms, sclerosis in an area previously reported as lytic, or disappearance of a previously noted

lesion on radionuclide bone scan. Patients who achieved a complete or partial response at the end of planned course of chemotherapy were registered, and if eligible, randomly assigned.
At the time of registration, patients underwent standard physical examination and mammography to document the extent of locoregional disease and metastatic tumour assessment with either contrast-enhanced CT scan of the chest and abdomen or PET-CT scan. An isotope bone scan was undertaken in all patients. Histopathological conﬁrmation of oestrogen receptor and progesterone receptor expression, and HER2 ampliﬁcation was obtained in all patients by use of standard immunohistochemical techniques. Core or incisional biopsy was done in all patients at the time of initial work-up as per institutional protocol and the tissue was paraﬃn embedded. Immunohistochemistry for HER2 protein expression was done with the 3B5 monoclonal antibody (Immunotech, Marseilles, France, dilution 1:10) and using the standard avidin-biotin complex peroxidase method. HER2 receptor ampliﬁcation was scored as per ASCO-CAP guidelines, where 1+ was regarded as negative, 3+ as positive, and 2+ as equivocal and requiring FISH testing for conﬁrmation, if the patient could aﬀord targeted treatment.

human estrogen receptor used was DAKO, Carpinteria, CA, USA (Clone 1D5; dilution 1:50), and the monoclonal mouse anti-human progesterone receptor was DAKO, Carpinteria, CA, USA (Clone PgR 636; dilution 1:50).
We assessed menopausal status at the time of presentation (before systemic chemotherapy) and deﬁned a patient as premenopausal if she gave a history of a regular menstrual cycle. Those who gave a history of no menstruation for up to 1 year before presentation were deﬁned as perimenopausal and those who gave a history of no menstruation for more than 1 year were deﬁned as postmenopausal.
Locoregional treatment consisted of a standard surgical procedure that was either mastectomy or breast conserving surgery accompanied by full axillary lymph node dissection. In patients with persistent or residual supra-clavicular lymph nodes, we did a supra-clavicular fossa dissection to achieve complete surgical clearance. Surgical margins were managed according to standard guidelines applicable in non-metastatic breast cancer.26 In premenopausal patients who continued to have menstrual cycles after chemotherapy and who had oestrogen or progesterone receptor-positive tumours, bilateral oophorectomy was done at the time of surgical removal of the primary tumour. Patients with oestrogen or progesterone receptor positive tumours received standard endocrine therapy after locoregional treatment, which was 20 mg per day tamoxifen for premenopausal patients and an aromatase inhibitor (2·5 mg letrozole per day or 1 mg anastrazole per day) or tamoxifen for post-menopausal patients, until disease progression.
Surgery was followed by standard postoperative adjuvant radiation treatment to the chest wall or remaining breast as per standard institutional practice for non-metastatic patients. In cases of modiﬁed radical mastectomy conventional external beam radiotherapy was delivered to the chest wall with or without the supraclavicular fossa at a dose of 45 Gy, 20 fractions over 4 weeks. For patients with breast-conserving surgery, the dose diﬀered depending on clinical stage. Women presenting with operable breast cancer who underwent breast conserving surgery received whole breast radiotherapy at a dose of 45 Gy, 25 fractions over 5 weeks with a tumour bed boost of 15 Gy, six fractions over 1 week. For those with locally advanced cancers, after breast-conserving surgery, the whole breast radiotherapy dose was 50 Gy, 25 fractions over 5 weeks with with a tumour bed boost of 15 Gy, six fractions over 1 week. All patients who underwent breastconserving surgery received postoperative radiation. In those patients who underwent mastectomy, those with a pre-chemotherapy tumour size of more than 5 cm or skin or chest wall involvement or axillary lymph node-positive disease received postoperative radiation.
Patients in the no locoregional treatment group were kept under observation after the last cycle of planned chemotherapy. If they were premenopausal, continued to have menstrual cycles after chemotherapy, and had

oestrogen or progesterone-receptor positive tumours, they underwent bilateral oophorectomy and received standard endocrine treatment as described until disease progression.
After completion of the study intervention, patients were followed up for survival and assessed for locoregional and distant progression. Patients were assessed once every 3 months; a detailed history was taken and a physical examination was done by one of the clinical investigators. Radiological assessment for metastatic progression (CT or PET-CT scan with or without radioisotope bone scan) was triggered by any clinical or symptomatic evidence of disease progression. Data from animal studies suggests that surgical intervention for metastatic breast cancer could be detrimental, with an increase in distant disease in the surgery group.4 Thus, as a safety measure, a single assessment, as described above, that was not triggered by symptoms was done at about 12 weeks from randomisation.
At the time of disease progression, patients received further treatment according to standard institutional practice, which was usually further appropriate systemic therapy that could include further lines of chemotherapy or endocrine treatment, if applicable. HER2-targeted therapy was allowed and encouraged in patients with HER2 receptor-positive tumours, if ﬁnancially feasible. Additionally, salvage surgery was oﬀered in the no treatment group for pain, fungation, or bleeding. Patients suitable for surgical salvage were those whose tumours were amenable to surgical resection (with either primary closure or ﬂap) with no likely gross residual disease after surgery. In symptomatic patients in whom surgical salvage was not feasible, palliative radiation was an option. After the accrual of the ﬁrst 100 patients in the study, subsequent patients underwent health-related quality-of-life assessments during follow-up visits using validated instruments (EORTC QLQ C-30 and BR-23).
Outcomes The primary endpoint was overall survival, deﬁned as the time from randomisation to death from any cause. Secondary endpoints were locoregional progression-free survival, distant progression-free survival, and healthrelated quality of life. An analysis of health-related quality of life in this trial has been done in a subset of patients and will be analysed and reported separately.27 For the purpose of classifying the site of progression, ipsilateral chest wall, breast, axilla, and supraclavicular regions were deemed to be within the locoregional ﬁeld, whereas other sites were regarded as distant. We deﬁned locoregional progression-free survival as the time interval from randomisation to the date of ﬁrst clinically or radiologically documented locoregional progression, deﬁned as more than a 25% increase in the size of pre-existing lesions or the appearance of new lesions in the locoregional ﬁeld. We deﬁned distant progression-free survival as the time

Patients who had locoregional progression or distant progression as their ﬁrst event were censored at this point of time for distant progression-free survival or locoregional progression-free survival, respectively.
Statistical analysis The trial was designed with overall survival as the primary eﬃcacy endpoint with a planned sample of 350 patients. The trial had 80% power to detect a hazard ratio of 0·75 for death from any cause with locoregional treatment compared with no locoregional treatment, with a two-sided alpha of 0·05. We hypothesised that overall survival with no locoregional treatment would be 18 months in the study population and would increase to 24 months with locoregional treatment.

Figure 3: Forest plot of overall survival subgroup analyses, unadjusted hazard ratios

The primary endpoint was assessed in the intentionto-treat population and tested by means of two-sided log-rank tests. We used Kaplan-Meier methods to estimate medians for the primary and secondary endpoints, 2-year survival, and corresponding 95% CI. Analysis of overall survival was done in pre-speciﬁed subgroups deﬁned by stratiﬁcation factors. Additionally, two post-hoc analyses were done to assess results in subgroups deﬁned by HER2 receptor status (nonampliﬁed vs ampliﬁed) and menopausal status (premenopausal or perimenopausal vs post-menopausal). We also used a multivariate Cox proportional-hazards model, with the stratiﬁcation factors, as well as HER2 status and menopausal status as covariates, to estimate

Results
From Feb 7, 2005, to Jan 18, 2013, 716 patients presented at Tata Memorial Centre with de-novo metastatic disease, of whom 25 were candidates for ﬁrst-line endocrine treatment and 14 (56%) of 25 were eligible to be randomly assigned to the treatment groups. The remaining 691 women received chemotherapy as their ﬁrst-line treatment, of whom 415 (60%) had a complete or partial response. Of the 415 responders, 336 (81%) were eligible to be randomly assigned. Of the 350 randomly assigned patients, 173 patients were assigned to locoregional treatment and 177 were assigned to no locoregional treatment (ﬁgure 1). Baseline demographic and disease characteristics were well balanced between groups (table 1). Median duration of follow-up was 23 months (IQR 12·2–38·7) at data cutoﬀ on Nov 1, 2013.
Table 2 shows details of chemotherapy and endocrine therapy received by patients before randomisation and after randomisation but before progression. Systemic therapies given to patients after progression are shown in table 3. Table 4 shows details of the surgical intervention and radiation treatment given to patients in both groups. Eight (5%) of 173 patients in the locoregional treatment group did not undergo locoregional treatment. 18 (10%) of 177 patients in the no locoregional treatment group underwent surgical removal of the primary tumour for palliation of symptoms upon progression a median 4·1 months (IQR 3–15) after randomisation (table 3). One patient in the locoregional treatment group had an adverse event related to surgery (wound infection, grade 3); no other adverse events were noted.
At the time of data cutoﬀ, we recorded 235 deaths (118 in the locoregional treatment group and 117 in the no locoregional treatment group). Locoregional treatment did not result in a signiﬁcant improvement in overall survival compared with no locoregional treatment (median survival 19·2 months [95% CI 15·98–22·46] vs 20·5 months [16·96–23·98]; HR 1·04, 95% CI 0·81–1·34; p=0·79; ﬁgure 2). 2-year overall survival was 41·9% (95% CI 33·9–49·7) in the locoregional treatment group and 43·0% (95% CI 35·2–50·8) in the no locoregional treatment group (ﬁgure 2).

later diagnosis in the natural course of de-novo metastatic disease in the Indian patient population. In this context, it is important to note that there is signiﬁcantly reduced overall survival in symptomatic versus asymptomatic patients with metastatic breast cancer20,30 and most of our patients had symptomatic disease.20,30 Moreover 107 (31%) of 350 patients had HER2 receptor-positive disease, but most of these (98 [92%]) patients did not receive HER2-targeted treatment because of ﬁnancial constraints. Additionally, only some patients received taxane-based chemotherapy, thus an association of these factors and overall survival was not assessed. However, because of randomised treatment allocation, these factors are unlikely to have aﬀected the outcome of this study.
An interesting ﬁnding in our study was the signiﬁcant detriment in distant progression-free survival in women who received locoregional treatment compared with those who did not. This ﬁnding is consistent with the results of preclinical studies,2–5 which showed growth of a metastatic tumour subsequent to the removal of the primary tumour. The mechanisms by which this might happen are unclear, but might include fresh surgical dissemination with increased adhesion of circulating tumour cells to the vascular endothelium of target organs,31 surgery-induced immunosuppression,32 surgeryinduced angiogenic switch, or the inﬂammatory cascade. It remains a matter of interest whether a similar growth advantage might also be conferred to micrometastatic disease in early breast cancer and whether events at the time of surgery can be modulated to gain long-term survival advantage.33 Based on our data, it could be argued that censoring patients who had local progression ﬁrst in the analysis of distant progression could lead to excess numbers of distant progression in patients who had received locoregional treatment. However, all patients who had local progression were assessed for distant metastatic disease and patients who had both local and distant progression were analysed for both local and distant progression-free survival. The detriment in distant progression-free survival is oﬀset by an improvement in local control and is consistent with the non-signiﬁcant diﬀerence in overall survival at 2 years.
One limitation of our study is that most patients were randomly assigned after receiving and responding to chemotherapy as their ﬁrst treatment. Therefore, the applicability of these results to patients who receive endocrine therapy or chemotherapy plus HER2-targeted therapy as their ﬁrst-line treatment is unknown, although there is no reason to believe that there is an interaction between these treatments and the eﬀect of locoregional treatment of the primary tumour.
In conclusion, there is no evidence to suggest that locoregional treatment of the primary tumour confers an overall survival advantage in patients with de-novo metastatic breast cancer and this procedure should not be routinely done.
