Abstract Background: Although the recommended minimal examined lymph node (ELN) number in rectal cancer (RC) is 12, this standard remains controversial because of insufficient evidence. We aimed to refine this definition by quantifying the relationship between ELN number, stage migration, and long-term survival in RC. Methods: Data from a Chinese multi-institutional registry and the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database on stage I to III resected RC (2008 2017) were analysed to determine the relationship between ELN count, stage
D migration, and overall survival (OS) using multivariable models. The series of odds
ratios (ORs) for negative-to-positive node stage migration and hazard ratios (HRs) for
E survival with more ELNs were fitted using a LOWESS smoother, and structural
breakpoints were determined using the Chow test. The relationship between ELN and
T survival was evaluated on a continuous scale using restricted cubic splines (RCS).
Results: The distribution of ELN count between the Chinese registry (n = 7,694) and
P SEER database (n = 21,332) was similar. With increasing ELN count, both cohorts
exhibited significant proportional increases from node-negative to node-positive
E disease (SEER, OR, 1.012, P < 0.001; Chinese registry, OR, 1.016, P = 0.014) and
serial improvements in OS (SEER, HR, 0.982; Chinese registry, HR, 0.975; both P < 0.001) after controlling for confounders. Cut-point analysis showed an optimal
C threshold ELN count of 15, which was validated in the two cohorts, with the ability to
properly discriminate probabilities of survival.
C Conclusions: A higher ELN count is associated with more precise nodal staging and Abetter survival. Our results robustly conclude that 15 ELNs are the optimal cut-off
point for evaluating the quality of lymph node examination and stratification of prognosis.

1. Introduction Surgical resection is the primary treatment for rectal cancer (RC).(1) Cancer
staging plays a key role in the choice of treatment strategy postoperatively; it also helps predict the long-term survival of patients with RC.(2) Presently, the TNM staging system of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) is the most recognised system for classifying the extent of spread of colorectal cancer.(3) The examined lymph node (ELN) is associated with the prognosis of RC patients, and a
D minimum of 12 ELNs has been considered the standard yield in colorectal cancer by
the College of American Pathologists (CAP) and AJCC.(4) The prognostic impact of
E these criteria has been confirmed in several clinical studies.(5-7) However, survival
prediction by N category is always affected by stage migration because the total
T number of ELNs could contribute to the change in metastatic lymph nodes, which
leads to up- or down-migration in the pathological N category.(8) Therefore, to
P achieve an optimum reliability of the pathological N category, the optimal number of
ELN to be surgical removed and pathologically examined needs to be carefully
E determined.(9, 10) Owing to the differences in various methodological approaches and study populations, the recommended optimal number of ELNs is significantly heterogenous
C in RC.(11, 12) Furthermore, ELN count is affected by a single factor or a combination
of factors, including characteristics of primary tumor, status of immune activation,
C extent of surgical resection, hospital volume and pathological examine methods, Awhich could influence stage migration and tumor staging of RC patients.(13)
Therefore, it is difficult to draw a favourable conclusion on the optimal ELN count from a small sample size or a single-centre study.(10, 14) As a result, optimal ELN count needs to be determined and validated in large population-based cohorts.
In the present study, we hypothesised that there was an optimal ELN count to be examined for accurate staging and prognostic prediction in RC. Hence, we performed this longitudinal international cohort study to (1) explore the ELN count after RC resection and (2) assess the effects of ELN count on tumour stage migration and long-

term survival of RC patients. 2. Method
2.1. Study Population Data from a multi-institutional registry of patients with RC who underwent
surgical resection between January 2009 and December 2018 at the departments of colorectal surgery at five medical institutions in China were collected. ELNs were harvested during surgical resection of the RC, and the tissue was examined postoperatively by pathologists. The ELN count was determined based on
D pathological findings. The patients were staged according to TNM Classification of
Malignant Tumours, 8th edition. This study was retrospectively registered with the
E Clinical Trials (NCT05572151). This work has been reported in line with the
STROCSS criteria (15), Supplemental Digital Content 1,
T http://links.lww.com/JS9/A757. In addition, data were collected from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End
P Results (SEER) database, an open-access database containing patient demographics,
tumour data, perioperative treatment data, and survival data. The database includes
E approximately 28% of the US population, with patient-level data abstracted from 18
geographically diverse populations that represent rural, urban, and regional populations. Data on RC cases diagnosed between January 2008 and December 2017
C in the SEER database were extracted to match the time span of the Chinese cohort.
Patients were uniformly reviewed and staged according to TNM Classification of
C Malignant Tumours, 8th edition. The details were retrieved using SEER*Stat version A8.1.5.
2.2.Patient Selection Because preoperative chemo/radiotherapy is a common cause of ELN
shrinkage(16), patients who received preoperative therapy were excluded from this study. Patients with stage I-III RC who underwent surgical resection for the first primary RC with at least one ELN were eligible. Patients with missing ELN counts or clinical features were excluded. Patients information (age, sex, and year of diagnosis), tumour data (TNM stage, histology, size, and differentiation), treatments (resection

type, chemotherapy), and outcome variables (follow-up time and survival status) were obtained from the SEER and China registries.
2.3.Statistical Analyses Categorical variables were presented as whole numbers and proportions, and
continuous variables were presented as medians with interquartile ranges (IQR). The 5-year overall survival (OS) of the study population was calculated using the KaplanMeier method; and differences in OS were assessed using the log-rank test. Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to determine the effect of ELN count
D on OS and to visualise survival curves, which were adjusted for other significant
prognostic factors (age, sex, tumour stage, grade, histology type, tumour size, and
E adjuvant chemotherapy). In addition, the relationships between ELN and OS were evaluated on a
T continuous scale with restricted cubic splines (RCS) based on a multivariable Cox
model with three knots at the 10th, 50th and 90th percentiles of ELN. The use of RCS
P has been widely described as a valid strategy for analysing the relationship between
survival and independent variables.(17) RCS are a smoothly joined sum of
E polynomial functions that do not assume linearity of the relationship between
variables and the response (i.e., survival).(18) In addition, the use of RCS allows the identification of the risk function inflexion point (i.e., threshold).(19)
C Based on the assumption that more ELNs present a greater opportunity to
identify positive ELNs, a binary logistic regression model was used to assess stage
C migration through the correlation of the ELN number and proportion of each node Astage category (node-negative versus node-positive)(20) after adjusting for other
potential confounders associated with ELN count and node stage. The curves of odds ratios (ORs; stage migration) of each ELN count compared
with one ELN (as a reference) and the curves of hazard ratios (HRs; OS) of each ELN count compared with five or fewer ELNs (as a reference) were fitted using the LOWESS smoother with a bandwidth of 2/3 (default).(21) Afterward, structural break points were determined by Chow test and piecewise linear regression with the use of “strucchange” and “segmented” R packages. The break points were considered the

threshold for clinical impact. All statistical analyses were performed using R software (version 4.0.4; http://www.r-project.org). P<0.05 was considered statistically significant. 3. Results
3.1. Patient Characteristics and Distribution of ELN A total of 21,332 and 7,694 patients with RC in the SEER and Chinese cohorts,
respectively, who met the eligibility criteria were included in this study. Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics of each cohort. Of these patients, the proportion of men
D was greater than that of women in both the Chinese (60.4%, 4649/7694) and SEER
(55.8%, 11907/21332) cohorts. The distribution of ELN counts (Figure 1) was largely
E consistent between the cohorts; the median number of ELN counts in the Chinese
cohort was 15 (IQR, 13-19) and that in the SEER cohort was 16 (IQR, 12-22).
T Besides, at least 12 LNs were retrieved in most patients in both the Chinese (85.8%,
6598/7694) and SEER cohorts (81.9%, 17475/21332).
P 3.2.Number of ELNs and Stage Migration The association of ELNs with the detection rate of positive LNs was assessed to
E clarify the relationship between ELN count and stage migration. As shown in
Supplementary Figure 1, Supplemental Digital Content 2, http://links.lww.com/JS9/A758, a higher number of ELNs was correlated with a
C higher LN positivity rate. Furthermore, after adjusting for potential confounders (age,
sex, T stage, N stage, grade, histology and tumour size), both cohorts showed a
C significantly proportional increase in N stage (from N0 to N1 and N2) with increasing AELN count (Chinese registry: OR, 1.016; 95% CI, 1.003 - 1.029; P = 0.014; SEER:
OR, 1.012; 95% CI, 1.009 - 1.015; P <0.001; Table 2, Supplemental Digital Content 3, http://links.lww.com/JS9/A759).
3.3.Number of ELNs and Overall Survival After controlling for other prognostic factors, including age, sex, T stage, N
stage, grade, histology, tumour size and adjuvant chemotherapy, a higher ELN number was positively correlated with better OS in patients in the SEER (HR, 0.982; 95%CI, 0.979 - 0.985; P <0.001) and in the Chinese cohorts (HR, 0.975; 95%CI,

Downloaded from http://journals.lww.com/international-journal-of-surgery by BhDMf5ePHKav1zEoum1tQfN4 a+kJLhEZgbsIHo4XMi0hCywCX1AWnYQp/IlQrHD3i3D0OdRyi7TvSFl4Cf3VC1y0abggQZXdgGj2MwlZLeI= on 07/21/2023

0.963 - 0.987; P <0.001), with a similar reduction in mortality risk. Notably, a consistent trend was observed (Table 2, Supplemental Digital Content 3, http://links.lww.com/JS9/A759) among patients with node-negative (N0) disease (SEER: HR, 0.978; 95%CI, 0.974 - 0.982; P <0.001; Chinese registry: HR, 0.980; 95%CI, 0.964 - 0.996; P = 0.014) and those with node-positive (N1 and N2) disease (SEER: HR, 0.987; 95%CI, 0.983 - 0.991; P <0.001; Chinese registry: HR, 0.972; 95%CI, 0.954 - 0.991; P = 0.005).
3.4.Cut-point Analysis
D For a more rigorous evaluation, a Cox model with RCS was created to flexibly
model and visualise the relationship between ELN and OS risk (Figure 2). The results
E were adjusted for age, sex, T stage, grade, histology, tumour size, and adjuvant
chemotherapy. The relationship between ELN on a continuous scale and the risk of
T OS was L-shaped. The risk of OS decreased rapidly until approximately 15 ELN
counts and afterward, the risk was relatively flat (P for non-linearity <0.001) both
P cohorts. For patients with an ELN count < 15, the multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio
for OS was 0.957 (95%CI, 0.947 - 0.968, P <0.001) in the SEER cohort and 0.932
E (95%CI, 0.898 - 0.967, P <0.001) in the Chinese cohort. For patients with an ELN
count of at least 15, the multivariable adjusted hazard ratio for OS was 0.993 (95%CI, 0.989 - 0.997, P = 0.001) in the SEER cohort and 0.992 (95%CI, 0.975 - 1.008, P =
C 0.322) in the Chinese cohort.
Figures 3 and 4 show the fitting curves and corresponding structural break points
C for the OR of stage migration and HR of OS after adjusting for other potential Aconfounders in the two cohorts. All break points were essentially consistent with
each other (varied from 12 to 15). Because survival is the most crucial issue and for representativeness and generalisability, we recommend 15 ELNs as the optimal threshold based on the RCS curve in the two cohorts and the fitting curve of HR, which was generated from the SEER cohort.
3.5.Comparison of optimal thresholds As international guidelines have uniformly adopted 12 ELNs as the proposed-
threshold for colorectal cancer, which originated from the 1990 World Congress of

Gastroenterology; and the ELN count was divided into three populations (ELN < 12, ELN: 12 - 14, ELN ≥ 15) in two cohorts. Survival analysis confirmed a significantly reduced all-cause mortality hazard for patients with at least 15 ELNs harvested in two cohorts (SEER database: HR12-14, 0.76; 95%CI, 0.71-0.82; P <0.001; HR≥15, 0.64; 95%CI, 0.60-0.68; P <0.001; Chinese registry: HR12-14, 0.82; 95%CI, 0.65-1.02; P = 0.075; HR≥15, 0.67; 95%CI, 0.55-0.82; P <0.001) after adjusting for other prognostic factors (Figure 5). Furthermore, the association remained significant in declared nodenegative (SEER database: HR12-14, 0.76; 95%CI, 0.69-0.84; P, <0.001; HR≥15, 0.61;

P Notably, although patients with at least 15 LNs harvested had better survival
outcomes than those with < 12 LNs, no significant differences in OS were observed
E between patients with 12-14 LNs harvested and those with < 12 LNs in the Chinese
cohort and node-negative disease patients. 4. Discussion
C To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the largest population-based
study of two real-world international cohorts. Although several studies have identified
C the optimal ELN number for colorectal cancer, most studies did not consider RC as an Aisolated tumour site.(22, 23) In addition, a large number of studies have focused on
RC patients treated with neoadjuvant therapy, and no relevant study has explored the optimal ELN number in RC patients without neoadjuvant therapy based on large population-based study.(14, 24)
Our findings indicated that a minimum of 15 ELNs were associated with an increased detection of metastatic ELN and improved survival for RC patients, which was confirmed in the US and Chinese large population-based cohorts. The total number of ELN is considered a powerful indicator of stage migration and survival

prediction in RC patients in clinical practice. The data provide strong support for retrieving a minimum of 15 ELNs in the context of potentially curative proctectomy for RC. According to our findings, ELNs count was associated with a decreased risk of stage migration and improved long-term survival in RC patients, which encourages surgeons and pathologists to pursue a maximal effort of ELNs.
The strengths of the present study include a long follow-up period as well as a large observational population with relatively homogeneous treatment exposure identified from the SEER database and Chinese multi-institutional registry. In
D addition, the statistical methods used for the analysis were essential for interpreting
the results. In the present study, several key statistical methods were used to obtain
E strong evidence for the selection of the optimal number of ELNs for RC, which could
provide a more valuable reference for the treatment of patients with RC in clinical
T practice. In the present study, the total number of ELNs was associated with stage
P migration, which was confirmed by the consistent positive correlation between a
larger ELN number and a higher proportion of advanced N categories in the US and
E Chinese populations. It is known that the detection of more ELNs in rectal specimens
could increase the likelihood of positive ELNs being detected, leading to an accurate N stage and the necessary implementation of adjuvant chemotherapy, thereby
C promoting the long-term survival of RC patients. Therefore, in the US and Chinese
cohorts, there were similar positive trends between a larger number of ELNs and
C better OS in RC patients with both metastatic and non-metastatic ELNs. AStage migration due to insufficient ELNs may partly explain the improved
survival of patients with a larger number of ELN. In addition to the reason for stage migration, a larger number of ELNs is related to a stronger anti-tumour immune response, which is considered a prognostic predictor for cancer patients.(25) Robust anti-tumour immune responses will lead to lymph node enlargement, which is easily detected by surgeons and pathologists in clinical practice. This also partly explains our previous findings that lymph nodes were more likely to be detected in younger patients than in older patients because of the stronger anti-tumour immune responses

of the younger hosts.(26) Therefore, the examination of a larger number of ELNs may contribute to improved survival due to a stronger immune response.(27) Although the interplay between tumour biology and host that may confer this survival improvement needs to be explained, native host’s anti-tumour immune response may play a key role.(28) Further studies are warranted to explore the biological reasons underlying the prognosis of patients with ELNs and anti-tumour immune responses.
However, several limitations of this study should be noted when interpreting the results. First, although the two international cohorts provided large population-based
D analyses with long-term follow-up information enabling the assessment of the
association between optimal ELN and patient outcome after adjusting for several
E confounding factors, we cannot overcome the retrospective nature of selection bias.
Second, it is well known that the number of ELN is affected by the shared
T responsibility of both surgeons and pathologists. However, because of the
retrospective design of the study, information regarding the surgeon for
P lymphadenectomy and the pathological evaluation of postoperative rectal specimen
could not be included and analysed in this study, which led to the inability to evaluate
E the influence of surgeons and pathologists on the number of ELN. Third, the change
in the number of ELN over time contributed to unavoidable bias because of the long period of spanning years in these two cohorts. However, we performed several
C statistical methods and checks to evaluate the feasibility of our findings. Fourth,
because this study was based on two real-world cohorts, the surgical procedures and
C pathological assessments of ELNs vary among surgeons, pathologists, and regions. A5. Conclusion
In conclusion, a minimum of 15 ELNs was associated with more accurate tumour staging and favourable long-term survival of RC patients. We recommend 15 ELNs as the optimal cut-off point for the assessment of the quality of postoperative pathological examination and prognostic stratification for RC patients. The novel optimal cut-off point has imposed an increased requirement for the routinely used AJCC nodal evaluation and has demonstrated compelling results based on external validation in a large cohort of the Chinese population, which suggest widely clinical

Figure 2. Association Between ELN count and survival Using Restricted Cubic Splines Model in the SEER database and the China registry. Hazard ratios are indicated by solid lines and 95% CIs by shaded areas. The range of ELN count was restricted to 1 to 59 in the SEER database (1 to 55 in China registry) because predictions greater than 59 and 55 (95th percentile) are based on too few data points.
