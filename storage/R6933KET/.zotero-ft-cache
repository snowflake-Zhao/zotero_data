 Imagine a world in which you can input your age, lifestyle, and genetic information (genome) into an app and obtain personalized recommendations about the food you should eat or avoid and behaviors you should modify to help maintain your health. Moreover, imagine that when you are sick, your physician inputs the same information to determine your customized treatment plan. That world is not 50 years into the future; in many respects it is beginning to unfold now. This book will reveal the essentials of personalized medicine (sometimes referred to as precision or individualized medicine), what is it, how will it affect you when you are healthy and when you are sick, and how personalized medicine will be implemented based on your DNA and other information.

PERSONALIZED MEDICINE 
What is personalized medicine? 
The practice of medicine has always been personal. Doctors use extensive personal information about a patient—including medical history, physical exam, vital signs, family history, laboratory measures, and imaging tests—to determine a patient’s risk for certain diseases and to make diagnoses. So what makes medicine more personalized now? The answer is that we have entered an era unlike any before. You may have heard about “big data” and its transformational effect on business operations across multiple industries. Medicine also is entering the era of big data. It is now possible to have your entire DNA sequence (your genome) decoded, measure tens of thousands of biomolecules in your body, use sensors to continuously follow physiology and activity, and characterize the microbial community that lives in your gut and other parts of your body. These comprehensive measurements have the potential to provide information about your health in exquisite detail, but, as with any big data set, they need to be integrated and interpreted. The hope is that ultimately this information will routinely be used to guide you to manage your health better, not just according to overall outcomes, but based on the experiences of other individuals. In addition to helping decide details about the medical care you get throughout your life, this information has the potential to guide you in many other aspects of your life: the

foods you eat, your lifestyle choices, and maybe even the jobs that you choose. There are many challenges to achieving this goal. Some genomic information we know how to interpret and some we do not; and some of what we think we know will be proven incorrect in the future. In addition, some people worry that despite numerous legal protections against genetic discrimination, genomic information may be used by insurance companies, employers, or others to discriminate against individuals who carry certain genetic markers. Furthermore, there are privacy concerns because it is nearly impossible to ensure that our genetic information will be kept 100% confidential. Some worry that genetic information might be used inappropriately in the social realm; for example, to influence what spouses we choose and whom we encourage our children to marry. Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, there is the challenge of how to pay for genomic sequencing and interpretation. In the United States in particular, healthcare systems primarily provide services to people after they have developed a disease or condition; prevention traditionally has been a lesser focus. Changing this paradigm will require a change in culture. 
What personal factors impact our health? 
To understand personalized medicine requires an understanding of the factors that contribute to our health (Figure 1). In general, our health is determined by our DNA, our lifestyle, and the things to which we are exposed, namely, our environment. Our DNA is inherited from our parents. Our lifestyle includes behaviors such as how much we exercise, whether we smoke, and what we choose to eat and drink. Most of us know that environmental factors such as the quality of the air we breathe, ultraviolet rays from the sun, and the presence of certain chemicals in household items can affect our health. Important environmental exposures, however, go well beyond these. 
 
 
 Personalized Medicine 3 
Pathogens such as viruses and bacteria can make us ill in the short-term, but may also increase our risk of certain chronic diseases in the longer term. Life stresses and the natural processes of aging also affect health. Conditions in the womb can impact development of the fetus and influence health after birth. In many cases, our understanding of the mechanisms by which environmental factors influence health is incomplete. Nonetheless, this information is crucial to understanding how to manage health.

GENOME FUNDAMENTALS 
When we visit the doctor, we are commonly asked to fill out a questionnaire about our family medical history, including major diseases such as cancer and heart disease experienced by our parents, siblings, and children. This is a rough way of gauging our risk of inheriting the factors leading to these diseases. All this information and more, however, resides encoded in our genome, and the current revolution underway in medicine is to decode and interpret our genomes to predict, prevent, and treat disease on an individualized basis. 
What is DNA? 
Our DNA is the instruction manual for guiding the process by which we develop from a single cell into a complicated being with many different cell types. We each start as a single cell, created by the fusion of a single sperm and egg. From that single cell, we grow into a mature human being comprised of 30 trillion cells. There are several hundred different cell types (estimates range from 200–300 major categories), each with a different function. For example, our intestinal cells help us absorb nutrients from food, our skin cells protect us from the environment, our retinal cells process light so that we can see, and the neurons in our brain help us to think and communicate. The information in DNA helps guide development and function of all the cells that make a human being. 
 
 
 6 GENOMICS AND PERSONALIZED MEDICINE 
DNA is a polymer made up of four constituent parts—four nucleotide bases (Figure 2). The nucleotide bases are adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and thymine (T). The instructions encoded by DNA are determined by the order in which those bases appear (just as the information in this book is determined by the order in which the words and letters appear). DNA is double-stranded and twisted into a spiral or helical 
Figure 2. Our DNA is made of four “letters” or (top) that are arranged in a specific order (middle). The bases are paired (middle), and the 6 billion bases are packaged into 46 chromosomes (bottom), 23 from our father and 23 from our mother.

shape, hence the common appellation, “the double helix.” The sequence of bases on one strand of DNA is complementary to the sequence of bases on the other strand. This arrangement arises because the bases on the two strands are paired: A (adenine) pairs with T (thymine), and C (cytosine) pairs with G (guanine). 
What is a genome? 
There are 6 billion base pairs of DNA in human cells. The entire 6 billion base pair collection of DNA is the genome. During cell division, the process by which one cell divides to form two new cells, the genomic DNA is copied so that each of the two new cells contains the entire genome. The genome is very longtwo meters if stretched end to end—but is tightly packaged to fit into a cell. The genome is contained on 46 chromosomes, 23 of which are inherited from the mother and 23 from the father (Figure 2). Two of the cell types that do not contain the entire genome are the egg and the sperm, which each contain only half the genome or 23 chromosomes. Our genome contains about 20,000 genes that code for proteins, which are the molecules that carry out many of our biological functions, or in other words, do much of the “work” in our cells (Figure 3). This work consists of processes like digesting our food, storing energy, or copying DNA to generate a new cell. For the most part, each of the various cell types in the body contains the same 46 chromosomes and generally has the same DNA. Cell types differ according to which genes are active, and thus, which proteins are present. For example, our immune cells make proteins called antibodies that bind pathogens and help clear them from our body, retinal cells make proteins that capture light and help us to see, and beta cells in our pancreas make the insulin protein that regulates glucose absorption by cells throughout the body. The regulatory framework that governs which proteins are expressed and at what levels in various cell types is contained in the DNA. 
 
 
 8 GENOMICS AND PERSONALIZED MEDICINE 
Proteins are not made directly from genes but rather through a derived close copy of DNA called “messenger” RNA; the production of this type of RNA is an intermediate step in the production of proteins from genes. In addition to protein-encoding genes, there are probably another 20,000 or more genes that encode other types of RNAs that are not made into proteins. The function of most of these RNAs is not known; many of those with known function appear to have a regulatory role in turning other genes on and off. Only about 2%–3% of our genome is accounted for by the ~40,000 genes that encode proteins and RNA. It is likely that 10% or more of our genome helps control the expression of genes (i.e., turns them on or off) in the various cell types. The purpose of most of the genome is not known, however, and may not have any direct function.

Figure 3. Our DNA encodes the 20,000 genes that make proteins that carry out many of the biochemical activities in our various types of cells. The proteins are not made directly from DNA. Rather our DNA makes a similar copy of itself called RNA, which in turns gets “translated” into forming proteins. Different proteins are expressed in distinct cell types to give cells their unique identity. 
 
 
 Genome Fundamentals 9 
What does the genome do? 
Our genome is solely responsible for many of our traits. These include physical traits such as eye and hair color and ear lobe shape. Our genome is also responsible for affecting behavior and complex diseases such as depression, autism, and schizophrenia. It also affects how we interact with our environmenteverything from our sensitivity to air pollution to how we react to alcohol intake and how well we derive nutrition from certain foods. For example, most of the adult world population cannot digest milk because the gene encoding the critical protein for digesting milk (lactase) is normally turned off post weaning. The exception is certain northern European populations and some other groups that do not turn off the lactase gene and thus can typically digest milk throughout their lives. Finally, our genome affects our susceptibility to particular diseases. The example of lactose intolerance due to lactase insufficiency is an example of a trait due to variation in a single gene (a monogenic trait). Many traits are multigenic, that is, they are determined by the interaction of the products of many genes. Determining the genetic cause of a monogenic trait is relatively easy; determining the genetic basis for a multigenic trait is more complicated. Finally, many traits are influenced not only by an individual’s genome but also by his or her environment; that is, traits may have both a genetic component and an environmental component. 
How does one person’s genome differ from another person’s genome? 
People differ from one another by several types of DNA sequence changes or “variants” (Figure 4a and 4b). Approximately 3.8 to 4 million variants, or one in every 1,200 bases, are single letter or base changes (termed single nucleotide variants, or “SNVs”). There are also about 500,000 to 850,000 small insertions and deletions of 1–100 bases (“indels”). Finally, there are also thousands of large insertions, deletions,

inversions, and other types of chromosome rearrangements, some as large as several hundred kilobases (1 kilobase = 1,000 bases) in length. These are called structural variants and although fewer in number than single nucleotide variants, they affect many bases and are an important contributor to genetic diversity among individuals. Many variants appear in the genes that encode proteins. A variety of evidence suggests, however, that most differences that make people differ from one another actually occur in the sequences that regulate gene expression, rather than occurring in the actual protein-coding sequences. These variants contribute to differences among individuals in physical, personality, and disease-susceptibility traits. With all the variation among genomes, you may be wondering why there are not more dramatic differences among individuals and not more individuals afflicted with genetic diseases. At the DNA level, the average difference between two unrelated individuals is believed to be approximately 0.1%. In a 6 billion base pair genome, this represents a substantial amount of DNA. However, not all differences in DNA sequence are functionally relevant. A variant may occur in a region of the genome that does not contain genes and does not have any critical function. Even if a variant occurs in a proteincoding gene, it may not necessarily affect the expression of that gene or the form of the protein that is produced. Furthermore, because individuals inherit DNA from both parents, for many genes there is a backup system—if the gene from the mother contains a deleterious variant, it may not have a discernible effect if the corresponding gene inherited from the father is fully functional. This backup system may not work in all cases; for example, if the product of the gene with the deleterious variant actually interferes with the activity of the “normal” gene or if proper expression of both maternal and paternal genes is required to achieve adequate gene product for normal function. Finally, if a variant has a profound adverse effect, it may interfere so severely with development that it causes fetal 
 
 
 12 GENOMICS AND PERSONALIZED MEDICINE 
death and that variant, therefore, is not found in living human populations. 
How do genomes of men and women differ? 
We all have 22 pairs of regular chromosomes, called autosomes, and two special chromosomes called sex chromosomes. Women have two copies of a sex chromosome known as the X chromosome. Men have one X chromosome plus a sex chromosome known as the Y chromosome. The Y chromosome is the smallest of all the chromosomes and contains a limited number of genes, many of which are involved in male sexual development. Many diseases that only affect men are related to variants in genes on the X chromosome. Because males only have one X chromosome, a variant that causes dysfunction or loss of function of a gene on the X chromosome is more easily manifested in a male than in a female. For example, a common form of red–green color blindness that is over 15 times more common in males than females is due to variants (mutations) in two photopigment genes on the X chromosome. Females have two X chromosomes and thus greater probability of having at least one functional copy of the photopigment genes. Other Xlinked diseases that are manifested primarily in males include hemophilia and certain forms of muscular dystrophy. Interestingly, although females carry two X chromosomes, in any given cell one of those X chromosomes is inactivated, and, as a result, gene expression on that chromosome is greatly reduced. X inactivation is believed to occur to prevent the accumulation of excess, potentially toxic levels of gene products of the X chromosome. As a result of X inactivation, females are genetic mosaics, a term used to describe populations of genetically different cells in the same person. A good representation of female genetic mosaicism related to X inactivation is the mottled fur color of tortoiseshell cats. The mottled pattern reflects the expression of different X-linked fur-color gene 
 
 
 Genome Fundamentals 13 
products on the two different X chromosomes. Depending on which X chromosome is active, either the orange or black pigment is produced. 
How is the genome decoded? 
The first whole human genome sequence was completed in draft form in 2001 and in a more finished form in 2003. The project took over a decade to complete, involved ~2,000 researchers, and cost $500 million to $1 billion. The genome sequence is a composite because it was prepared using DNA pooled from several individuals, and thus does not represent a single individual’s genome. The genome sequence was determined primarily using technologies that decoded short fragments, ~1,000 bases in length, and computer-based assembly of those short “reads” into longer continuous sequences based on information from fragment overlaps. The longer continuous sequences of about 150,000 base pairs in length were mapped and assembled into the whole genome sequence based on a previously developed rough map of the genome. The final sequence, referred to as the “reference genome,” is approximately 3 billion base pairs in length, and includes each of the 22 autosomes plus the X and Y sex chromosomes. Some gaps in the reference genome sequence still exist; these occur in regions of the genome that are difficult to sequence using current technologies or that are highly variable among people. Using current technologies, it is now possible to sequence an individual’s genome in a few days. The present approach involves sequencing millions of short fragments, typically about 100–150 bases in length (Figure 5a and Figure 5b). The fragment sequences are mapped to the reference genome and variants with respect to the reference are identified (or “called” in geneticists’ lingo). The methods have a ~1% error rate. Therefore, to ensure accuracy, each base is typically sequenced an average of 30 times (i.e., the “sequencing depth” is 30-fold

or 30X). This method works well for calling single base variants and short insertions and deletions. Larger structural variants (large insertions, deletions and inversions), however, are more difficult to determine and specially designed computer algorithms are used to find them (Appendix A). The end result is that a person’s genome sequence is defined as variants relative to a reference sequence; and those variants that land in a gene associated with human disease are scrutinized most heavily to assess whether they might be disease-causing. It is important to note that either one copy or both copies of any given gene (i.e., genes from both parents) can contain a variant with respect to the reference sequence, and it is also possible that different variants can be found in the same or both copies of any given gene. Phasing is a process by which variants are mapped to the same or opposite chromosomes. If two variants occur together on the same chromosome they are “in phase.” Phasing is important for predicting the functional consequence of variants in a given gene (Figure 6). For

Figure 6. The importance of “phasing variants.” When two deleterious variants reside in one gene copy and none on the other, one good copy exists (top). However, if both gene copies carry a deleterious mutation, then both copies are inactivated and this can result in disease. When the mutations are different, this situation is called a “compound heterozygote.” Thus, it is important to not only identify variants but know where they lie relative to one another. 
 
 
 16 GENOMICS AND PERSONALIZED MEDICINE 
example, if sequencing reveals the presence of two deleterious variants affecting a gene that has an important role in taste, and phasing reveals that the two deleterious variants are on the same chromosome (in the same copy of a gene), the copy of the gene on the opposite chromosome will be unaffected and the presence of the normal gene product might mask the effect of the deleterious variants—and the sense of taste will be normal. In contrast, if the two deleterious variants occur in separate copies of the gene (i.e., the genes from both parents are affected), no normal gene product will be produced—and the sense of taste will be compromised. To date many genomes have been sequenced. A large scale project called the “1000 Genomes Project” has determined the genome sequences of over one thousand people from highly diverse backgrounds and regions around the world. One of the products of this effort is a catalog of many of the common variants found in human populations. Over 50 million variants have been identified. In addition, over one thousand healthy people have had their genomes sequenced, including many individuals who are excited about the potential of personalized medicine and genomics and, therefore, often committed their own resources to have their genome sequence determined. These include celebrities such as Ozzy Osbourne and Glenn Close and many regular people as well. Additionally, many thousands of individuals with diseases such as cancer or diseases of unknown causation have had their genomes sequenced. There are alternatives to whole genome sequencing that determine DNA sequences of specific, targeted areas of the genome. For example, exome sequencing is aimed at determining the sequences of the protein-coding regions of the genome (Figure 7 and Figure 8). The exome is the portion of the genome that encodes RNA, which is carrying out many of the biological functions—it is the part of the genome that

Figure 7. Genes can be divided into sections, with only some sections represented in the final, mature RNA. The parts of the gene that encode the mature RNA are called exons; the intervening noncoding regions (which are removed or “spliced” out in the final, mature RNA) are called introns. The exome refers to the portion of the genome that is represented in mature RNA. Presently, it is the easiest part of the genome to interpret.

Figure 8. Exome sequencing. Probes can be used to capture only the exome-coding regions of the genome, which can then be sequenced. Because the protein coding exome comprises only ~1%–2% of the total genomic DNA, exome sequencing results in an enormous cost savings compared with sequencing the entire genome. Also, because the scale is smaller, the exome is amenable to deep sequencing, which allows detection of rare variants that might otherwise be overlooked (as can occur in cancer; see Chapter 4). 
 
 
 18 GENOMICS AND PERSONALIZED MEDICINE 
is easiest to interpret. Other even more targeted approaches determine the sequences of particular subsets of genes that are commonly implicated in certain diseases. These various targeted approaches have historically been less expensive than whole genome sequencing and can provide more accurate sequence information for the regions of interest because “deeper” sequencing is feasible, meaning that the region can be sequenced more times. Exome and targeted approaches may increase the ability to detect heterogeneity (for example, somatic mutations in a subset of tumor cells) in a sample (see Chapter 4). Although the targeted approaches may be more resource- and time-efficient and permit increased depth and accuracy compared with whole genome sequencing, these advantages must be weighed against the lesser amount of sequence information obtained. Also, targeted approaches are limited in their ability to detect structural variants. On the other hand, whole genome sequencing generates a more complete set of information, but its value is necessarily constrained by our current limited knowledge about the non-protein coding regions of the human genome and their role in health and disease. Exome sequencing is presently the most widely used method for decoding a person’s DNA, but whole genome sequencing is gaining in popularity.

AN INTRODUCTION 
TO CANCER GENETICS 
What is cancer and how does it arise? 
The ability to sequence genomes inexpensively has had enormous impact in medicine and helped usher in the new era of personal genomics. One of the areas of highest impact is cancer, which will strike 40% of men and women at some point in their lifetime. The ability of each cell in our bodies to grow and divide is tightly controlled by genetic factors; most cells in our bodies either stop dividing all together after we reach adulthood or divide rarely. Cancer results from the loss of these controls, leading to cells that grow and divide uncontrollably. When caught early, cancer often can be managed successfully. If cancer is not detected and treated, however, it may spread to other sites in the body in a process called metastasis. If this occurs, the cancer typically becomes more difficult to treat and can often be fatal. Certain cancers, such as ovarian and pancreatic cancer are often caught late because symptoms are absent or mild until the disease has advanced, and, therefore, these cancers have higher mortality rates. One of the underlying causes of cancer is genetic mutations that affect cell growth and division, also called cell proliferation. 
 
 
 22 GENOMICS AND PERSONALIZED MEDICINE 
These mutations fall into two general categories: those that actively drive cell proliferation and those that remove the constraints on cell proliferation. Mutations that stimulate cell proliferation are typically dominant and affect one copy of a gene; the presence of another, normal copy of the gene does not offset or mask the effects of the mutation. These dominant mutations transform a normal gene with cancer-causing potential (called a proto-oncogene) into a cancer-driving gene called an oncogene. We also have a number of genes that encode factors that put the brakes on uncontrolled cell proliferation. These genes are called tumor suppressor genes and generally both copies of the gene must be mutated for a cancer-promoting effect. In general, development of cancer requires mutations in several different genes—cancers have multigenic causation. This is because there are multiple mechanisms at work in normal cells to ensure that cell growth and division occur at the appropriate times in the proper locations. The body also has defense mechanisms to eliminate certain abnormal cells before they can become cancerous. For most cancers, it is generally believed that mutations accumulate sequentially during a person’s lifetime (Figure 9). The person remains healthy until they have enough mutation(s) that wipe out the compensatory mechanisms and thus allow neoplastic, uncontrolled growth. As a tumor continues to grow and the cells rapidly divide, additional mutations may occur that make the tumor more aggressive, for example, or more able to metastasize. Many different mutation types may contribute to carcinogenesis. DNA mutations may be present at birth or may occur spontaneously during our lifetimes. Mutations that we inherit from our parents are termed “germline” mutations and are generally present in all the cells in our bodies. The term “germline” comes from the origin of these mutations in the germ cells—the sperm or egg. Germline mutations are responsible for the cancers that run in families that lead to high predisposition for cancer. 
 
 
 Cancer Genetics 23 
Mutations that one acquires during one’s lifetime are termed “somatic” mutations. Somatic mutations may result when an error is introduced into DNA during cell division or from DNA damage (e.g., damage resulting from exposure of DNA in skin cells to ultraviolet rays from the sun). Somatic mutations are not passed down from parent to child. Germline and somatic mutations can be single base changes, indels, and/or large structural variations. One type of mutation that is common in many cancers is gene fusion. Gene fusions typically result from chromosome rearrangements that fuse a gene or its regulatory sequence to a proto-oncogene. This results in aberrant, continuous expression or activity of the protein product of the proto-oncogene and uncontrollable proliferation of the cells containing the gene fusion. The first fusion gene to be implicated in cancer was the BCR-ABL fusion, which is a hallmark of chronic myeloid leukemia and occurs in > 95% of cases. Several hundred different gene fusions have been implicated in a variety of cancers.

Figure 9. For many cancers, multiple mutations in proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressors are believed to be responsible for uncontrolled cell proliferation. These are generally thought to accumulate over time. Mutations in DNA repair and chromosome integrity genes such as MLH and BRCA1 are particularly deleterious because they can dramatically increase the rate at which cancer-causing mutations arise. 
 
 
 24 GENOMICS AND PERSONALIZED MEDICINE 
How do the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes cause cancer? 
BRCA1 and BRCA2 have received a lot of attention because of the link between harmful mutations in these genes and breast and ovarian cancer. BRCA1 and BRCA2 encode tumor suppressor proteins. One of the functions of these proteins is to help repair damaged DNA and maintain genomic stability. Women who are born with one defective copy will often lose the function of the remaining copy at some point in time, and this then leads to chromosomal changes and cancer at a very high incidence. The frequency of women with single BRCA1 and BRCA2 germline mutations developing breast or ovarian cancer before age 70 is over 80%. Some women who inherit harmful mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 opt for surgical removal of their breasts and/or ovaries to reduce their risk of developing cancer. The possible presence of germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations may be suspected in individuals with close family members that developed breast and/ or ovarian cancer at an early age. Such individuals can get tested to see if they carry a harmful BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation. Genetic testing is helpful but not always conclusive (see detailed discussion in Chapter 8). Sequencing may reveal a mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2, but it may not be possible to determine whether the mutation is harmful. Furthermore, BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations are not always inherited; sometimes they occur spontaneously, that is, as somatic mutations, and, therefore, may not be detected in the blood or saliva sample used for genetic testing because they are not present in every cell of the body. Although mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 are established causes of familial breast cancer, they still only account for 15%20% of such cases (Figure 10). Mutations in other genes also can be responsible for familial cancer but are present at lower frequency. It is also possible that undiscovered mutations in the regulatory regions of BRCA1 and BRCA2 account for additional cases of familial cancer. A recent study of women with a family history of breast cancer, who had normal BRCA1 and 
 
 
 Cancer Genetics 25 
BRCA2 revealed that 10% had mutations in an additional 42 genes. Thus, gene panels that go beyond BRCA1 and BRCA2 are likely to be useful in determining an individual’s genetic predisposition for breast cancer. Much more work needs to be done, however, to elucidate the genetic basis of breast cancer, particularly for the 70% of familial breast cancer cases for which no candidate genes have been identified.

and contribute to cancerous growth (Figure 11a). There are many genes that, when mutated, can cause loss of control of cell proliferation and contribute to cancer. Examples of some genes commonly implicated in cancer are shown in Table 1. 
How does genetic information help us treat cancer? 
Genetic information may be useful in tailoring cancer treatment to the specific molecular characteristics of a tumor. Although cancers have traditionally been described by their tissue of origin (e.g., breast cancer, lung cancer, or prostate cancer), in reality cancers of the same tissue may look and behave very differently depending on which mutations are present and which genes are expressed. This is known as the cancer’s molecular “signature.” For example, breast cancer may be classified into various types based upon which proteins are expressed on the surface of the tumor cells. Breast tumors that express human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2), estrogen receptor (ER), and progesterone receptor (PR), or are triple negative (do not express HER2, ER, or PR) behave differently and have different prognoses. Tumors that are HER2 positive are treated with medications that bind to HER2 (trastuzumab, lapatinib) and inhibit its activity. ER and PR are hormone receptors, and ER/PR positive tumors are treated with antihormonal therapies. Triple negative tumors have the poorest prognosis and are unlikely to respond to HER2-targeted therapies or antihormonal therapies. Such cancers are usually treated very aggressively with chemotherapy. As more has been learned about the molecular signature of various cancer subtypes, therapies that are specifically targeted to those signatures have been developed. Conventional chemotherapy acts on all rapidly dividing cells and does not distinguish between cancer cells and normal cells. Chemotherapy may cause substantial side effects, because normal, rapidly dividing cells (e.g., those lining the stomach) are killed along with cancer cells. Radiation therapy is another general approach

to eliminating rapidly dividing cells and has the advantage that it can be directed specifically at the tumor site; however, surrounding normal cells may still be affected. The normal cells that survive chemotherapy and radiation therapy may sometimes acquire harmful mutations that may cause them to become cancerous in the future. The new, targeted therapies attack tumor cells with greater precision and specificity than conventional chemotherapy approaches, and, therefore, can have enhanced antitumor effects and reduced associated side effects. One notable example of the power of a targeted cancer therapy is imatinib, which is very effective for treating Chronic

Myelogenous Leukemia (CML). Imatinib specifically inhibits the BCR-ABL fusion protein that is constitutively activated in CML. Another targeted therapy, erlotinib, inhibits a receptor involved in cell growth control, the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). EGFR is often mutated in many types of cancer, and erlotinib actually binds tighter and, therefore, is more inhibitory against those mutated forms of EGFR than against normal EGFR. Erlotinib is efficacious in the treatment of tumors that carry those mutated forms of EGFR. In the above examples, a sample of the tumor (e.g., biopsy) is tested to determine the molecular signature. Testing may be by genetic sequence tests (e.g., for BCR-ABL, mutated EGFR, or HER2 gene amplification) or tissue protein stains (e.g., for the presence of ER/PR receptors or HER2 protein overexpression). The results of the testing will guide the choice of treatment—it will be personalized for the individual. Tailored treatment based upon results of molecular characterization of tumor cells is fairly common in oncology. The molecular characterization, however, is usually confined to those factors (aberrant proteins, mutated genes) that are typically associated with a given tumor type. Also, molecular characterization is usually limited to known prognostic factors and a handful of high-frequency “druggable targets,” that is, factors common in a given tumor type and for which targeted therapies exist. Rare but potentially “druggable” changes might be present but overlooked. Also, because the molecular characterization of the tumor is limited to already known, well-characterized factors, the information generated has limited value for advancing our overall understanding of cancer biology.

GENOMICS AND CANCER 
TREATMENT 
What has been learned from genome sequencing of cancer? 
With the ability to sequence whole genomes and exomes, attention has quickly turned to trying to understand the full spectrum of genetic mutations that underlie cancer. Now the genomes or exomes of tens of thousands of cancers have been sequenced and a number of important new insights into cancer biology have been revealed: 
1. Every tumor is different and has a different genomic profile. 2. Certain mutations are common in specific cancers. For example, many cancers have mutations in the tumor suppressor gene, TP53; many colon and ovarian cancers have mutations in the RAS pathway; and 40%–60% of melanomas have a very specific mutation in the BRAF proto-oncogene. Although the genetic basis of certain cancers was known prior to whole genome sequencing, our knowledge of the genes and biological pathways commonly mutated in many different types of cancers has been greatly expanded. 3. Different types of cancers can have mutations in the same proto-oncogene. For example, mutations in the BRAF gene commonly occur in melanoma but also appear in 
 
 
 32 GENOMICS AND PERSONALIZED MEDICINE 
many other cancers such as colon cancer and thyroid cancer. 4. Although there are many different types of cancer, the underlying molecular defects typically affect just a dozen or so processes or “pathways” (Figure 11b). The pathways are often involved in cell growth and proliferation or in repair of DNA damage. For example, breast cancers often have mutations in the pTEN pathway and Rb pathways, which affect cell growth as well as in the BRCA genes, which affect DNA repair pathways. Mutations in genes in DNA repair pathways (e.g., MLH and BRCA genes) can lead to accumulation of mutations in tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes, giving rise to the cancer indirectly. 5. Overall, it is very clear that cancers are best classified not only by tissue of origin (i.e., the conventional classification system), but also by their underlying molecular defects. 
How can genome sequencing advance cancer treatment? 
Because every tumor is different and has its own genetic makeup, it is ideally suited for personalized medical management based on genomic information. Although not yet a routine part of care, when genomic analysis is performed, the tumor genome is typically sequenced at more than 80-fold coverage, that is, every base is sequenced 80 times on average (Figure 12); many researchers recommend 200 fold or even higher coverage. Normal DNA isolated from blood or saliva of the same patient also is often sequenced. The sequencing might be of the whole genome, the exome, or a large set of genes implicated in cancer (e.g., Foundation Medicine sequences a panel of 315 genes*). The latter approaches (exome sequencing; gene panel

sequencing) are not as ideal for detecting structural variants, but because they allow deeper sequencing, they may detect variants present in only a subset of the tumor cells. Variants may be present in only a portion of tumor cells because tumors are heterogeneous. Although tumors arise from a single abnormal cell, as the cells in the tumor rapidly divide it is common for new mutations to arise leading to subpopulations of tumor cells with distinct genomic profiles. New mutations accumulate because tumor cells often carry mutations that adversely affect the controls on genome integrity. Deeper sequencing also may provide more sensitive detection of variants in cases

where a great deal of normal tissue is present in the tumor sample. Somatic mutations unique to the tumor cells are revealed by identification of variants (i.e., changes) in the tumor cells compared with the normal DNA. The biggest challenge is to identify which variants are most likely to be “driver mutations,” that is, mutations that actively contribute to the growth of the tumor. This task can be especially daunting when whole genome sequencing is performed on tumor cells from advanced cancers because there can be many thousands of somatic mutations compared with the normal DNA from the same person. Indeed, some types of cancer typically have tens of thousands of variants! One typically looks for mutations in known proto-oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes—of highest interest are those mutations that affect targets of FDAapproved drugs or drugs in clinical trials, that is, druggable targets. Examples include EGFR and PDGFR; these are inhibited by erlotinib and sunitinib, respectively. As an example, we sequenced the genome of a metastatic colon cancer patient and found increased copies of the EGFR gene (Figure 13). This patient was treated with an EGFR inhibitor as part of his therapy. Examples of the many targeted drug treatments often used for non-small-cell lung cancer are shown in Table 2.

 Cancer Treatment 35 
In addition to finding somatic changes in a person’s cancer, usually by sequencing a person’s normal DNA, the presence of common germline mutations that increase the risk of cancer is also investigated. Although these germline mutations are usually not “druggable,” the information may be useful for determining prognosis and is valuable for family members of the patient in determining their own cancer risk. Indeed, there have now been a number of instances where sequencing the normal and cancer DNA of one family member has revealed a germline mutation that has alerted other family members of their own increased cancer risk. Genomic analysis might reveal the presence of a potential driver mutation that is not targeted by standard treatment for a given type of cancer. It may be that a drug targeting the effects of that driver mutation is commercially available, but only approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for another form of cancer. Or, it may be that a drug targeting the effects of that driver mutation is not commercially available, but is accessible to patients through a clinical trial. The oncologist might use the information from the genomic analysis to select a nonstandard, personalized treatment for the patient. In the scenario described here, the oncologist might use the evidence of the driver mutation to treat the patient with an off-label targeted therapy. “Off-label” refers to the

 36 GENOMICS AND PERSONALIZED MEDICINE 
use of drugs outside of their FDA-approved prescribing information. Physicians have discretion to prescribe off-label, but should have a scientific rationale for doing so. As an example, a drug that targets mutant forms of EGFR and that is approved only for the treatment of lung cancer may be prescribed by an oncologist for colon cancer if testing reveals that the colon cancer cells carry a mutated EGFR and the clinician feels that the patient would be an appropriate candidate for the drug. Physicians’ liability risk may be greater when prescribing an off-label use, depending on how strong the scientific evidence is to support that use. Insurance companies and other third party payers (e.g., Medicare) might require documentation from the physician of the scientific rationale before they will agree to pay for off-label use. In an alternative resolution to the scenario described here, the oncologist might use the evidence of the driver mutation to recommend the patient enroll in a clinical trial in which the drug under investigation targets the effects of the driver mutation. The potential for genomic analysis to help guide personalized treatment for cancer is generating considerable excitement. The hope is that drugs will no longer be used against cancer in situations where they have an extremely low probability of success, and, more importantly, targeting drivers of uncontrolled growth present in a given tumor in a timely manner will be highly effective with reduced side effects. It is important, however, to note that most of these therapies are usually targeted at late-stage cancer patients. Most patients follow the normal course of treatment that has been well established, and many of the drugs used are new and have adverse side effects. As drugs become more specific and their efficacy better known, however, it is expected that these targeted approaches and therapies will be administered to earlier stage patients and become more commonplace. Another area of active research is the use of genomic and gene expression data to determine when to start anticancer treatment. All anticancer treatments carry a risk of side effects. 
 
 
 Cancer Treatment 37 
For the patient (and the physician), it would be extremely useful to know how aggressive the cancer they are dealing with is so that they can make a well-informed decision about whether to start treatment immediately or delay treatment and just keep a close eye on tumor growth (“active surveillance”). This information would be especially useful in cases where the cancer is quite likely not to be aggressive, whereas treatments may have serious, life-altering side effects. For example, early stage prostate cancer often progresses very slowly over the course of many years, and some treatments may cause incontinence or impotence. Thus distinguishing aggressive versus nonaggressive prostate cancer would be valuable for knowing when and what type of treatment to use for that cancer. 
If I have cancer should I get my tumor genome sequenced? 
When genome sequencing first became available, many physicians avoided it citing concerns about its accuracy, the complexity of its interpretation, and its limited value in informing treatment decisions. These concerns still persist among some physicians today, but it is hard to imagine that these concerns will persist much longer. Aside from cost, there is nothing to lose by sequencing the tumor genome or at least the genes encoding known druggable targets and prognostic factors—one can, in fact, gain information. The following are possible outcomes of a cancer genome analysis with regard to treatment decisions: 
(a) Nothing new will be learned (b) The analysis will support the patient’s current course of treatment (c) New information will be revealed, suggesting a new course of treatment (d) Relevant information about an individual patient’s likely sensitivity to certain drugs will be revealed (e) The information will be used for immunotherapy (see below). 
 
 
 38 GENOMICS AND PERSONALIZED MEDICINE 
We have found that (b) and (c) are frequent outcomes. The genome sequence might confirm that the patient is on the right course of treatment. For example, we sequenced the tumor DNA of a breast cancer patient whose tumor previously tested HER2positive; the sequence revealed extra copies of the HER2 gene and confirmed that her current course of HER2-targeted therapy was indeed reasonable. Because initial screening may generate a false positive, the genome analysis provides helpful confirmatory evidence. An example of scenario (c) might be a breast cancer patient who has completed several courses of chemotherapy, has met her lifetime allowable dose of anthracycline-based therapy (i.e., certain types of chemotherapy are no longer possible for this patient), and tumor genome analysis reveals abnormal activation of a cell signalling pathway that is targeted by a drug currently in clinical trials. If the patient is eligible for one of those clinical trials and the oncologist determines the trial would be appropriate for this patient, the patient could be encouraged to enroll. Information revealed about an individual patient’s drug sensitivity (scenario “d”) might include whether that individual would be expected to rapidly or slowly metabolize certain anticancer drugs. Individuals with genetic variants associated with slower metabolism of a given drug will take longer to clear that drug from their body and require lower drug dose (to avoid accumulation of the drug and associated side effects); conversely, individuals with faster metabolism will require higher doses of the drug (to ensure sufficient drug exposure in the body to fight the tumor cells). Finally, if an individual has genetic variants that result in a seriously compromised ability to metabolize a given drug, that drug may be toxic and not suitable for administration to that individual. Presently, drug sensitivity screening before treatment is possible for several chemotherapy drugs (6-mercaptopurine, thioguanine, capecitabine, 5-fluorouracil, and irinotecan) and this 
 
 
 Cancer Treatment 39 
list will likely expand dramatically in the future as more genome sequences are determined. 
Why do anticancer drugs fail and how might genomic approaches help address this issue? 
For advanced cancers, nearly all cancer drugs eventually fail. This can occur at two stages: upon initial treatment and through recurrence of the cancer. Some patients do not respond to a drug initially even though genetic information suggested otherwise. This can be due to additional mutations present in the targets, which confer resistance, or because other cellular pathways are active in the tumor pathway, which counteract the treatment. One example involves EGFR. Patients with a common mutation in the EGFR gene (EGFR L858R) are sensitive to erlotinib; however, patients can have a second mutation (EGFR T790M) which confers resistance and thus they do not respond to the therapy. Therefore, understanding the complete picture is very important for treating these patients. In most cases, we do not understand why a set of patients do not initially respond to treatments and efforts are underway to identify the “bypass” mutations and pathways. One of the major challenges of cancer treatment is that even if treatment makes a tumor stop growing or makes it shrink, as long as the tumor remains, drug-resistance nearly always emerges over time—even in cases in which treatment is highly targeted against a major driver of uncontrolled proliferation, such as mutant BRAF in melanoma. Sometimes resistance appears quickly and sometimes it emerges after several years. The emergence of drug resistance may be understood in the context of tumor heterogeneity. As discussed earlier in this chapter, the cells that compose a tumor are not genetically identical and new mutations arise as cancer cells grow. Additionally, previous chemotherapy efforts may cause new mutations to appear in a tumor that is not completely eliminated. Furthermore, all the cells that compose a tumor may 
 
 
 40 GENOMICS AND PERSONALIZED MEDICINE 
not share the same gene expression pattern (even if they are genetically identical)—for example, differences in where they are located within the tumor may affect which genes are expressed. Certain genetic variants and certain gene expression profiles present in only one or a small number of tumor cells may make those cells less susceptible or resistant to the effects of an anticancer drug. In the presence of the drug, the less susceptible/resistant cells continue to grow and divide. They may even pick up additional mutations that further promote proliferation and/or make them more drug-resistant. Eventually there will be enough of these drug-resistant cells to make tumor growth detectable. There are a variety of biological mechanisms underlying drug resistance that might be detected by tumor genome sequencing. For targeted drugs, resistance might be related to the presence of a subset of cells that do not express the target because they do not carry the driver mutation and/or carry additional mutations that alter the interaction of the drug with the target. To be effective, many drugs need to be internalized and accumulate within tumor cells. Drug resistance can be related to mutations that disable the mechanism by which the drug is internalized or hyperactivate the mechanism by which the drug is removed from cells. Drug resistance also might be related to genetic variants that activate compensatory mechanisms that offset the detrimental effect of a drug on a tumor cell (e.g., if a drug damages tumor cell DNA, repair mechanisms might be activated). Combination therapy in which two or more drugs are administered together is common in cancer treatment and helps address tumor heterogeneity and the emergence of drug resistance. This is poorly understood in many cases, however, and efforts are underway to optimize combination therapies. In the future, it will be important to understand the exact genetic composition of each person’s tumor, its evolution, and the effectiveness of drug combinations based on this information so that individualized treatments can be prescribed most effectively.

Can genetics and genomics help detect early cancer and monitor treatment effectiveness? 
Many cancers, such as ovarian cancer and some kidney cancers, are typically only detected when they are relatively far advanced, because they may not be associated with noticeable symptoms in the earlier stages. One remarkable discovery in the past few years has been the finding that the DNA of solid tumor cells often can be found in the blood. This presumably occurs through the death of cancer cells whose contents are then released into the bloodstream. The discovery of this circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is important because it offers the possibility that a simple blood test might be used for detection of “silent” early cancers. Indeed, in a recent study designed to detect regions from 139 genes that frequently carry somatic mutations in non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), ctDNA was detected in approximately 50% of patients with early (Stage I) NSCLC and in all of the patients with more advanced (Stage II–IV) NSCLC. This type of ctDNA assay is theoretically adaptable to many types of cancer, and it is likely that screening for ctDNA will become a standard component of early detection in the future for individuals known to be at risk for certain cancers. This raises the possibility that screening for cancer lesions using ctDNA in the blood may someday become routine. Consistent with this idea, it has been recently discovered that analysis of ctDNA in pregnant women for chromosome aberrations in the fetus (see Chapter 9), has revealed the presence of cancer DNA in the woman! Thus, it may be that expectant women will be among the first to receive this type of screening. Other potential applications of ctDNA analysis are in patients already diagnosed with cancer—to monitor the effect of treatment, detect cancer recurrence, and even provide some insight into prognosis. Some studies have shown that after surgery to remove a tumor, the presence of residual ctDNA is associated with an increased risk of tumor recurrence. Thus ctDNA screening after surgery might be useful for identifying patients 
 
 
 42 GENOMICS AND PERSONALIZED MEDICINE 
who should receive chemotherapy to eliminate remaining tumor cells. An increase in ctDNA in a patient whose cancer has been treated successfully could be an early sign of cancer recurrence. Sequence analysis of ctDNA provides a “real-time” look at the mutation profile of the tumor cells and could be helpful in determining prognosis. Finally, ctDNA could conceivably be used for tumor DNA analysis in cases where it is not possible to biopsy or not desirable to subject a patient to the risks of a tumor biopsy procedure. For example, for a patient with NSCLC who is in poor health and not responding to current treatment, and for whom lung biopsy is considered too high risk, analysis of ctDNA could be helpful for determining which somatic mutations are present and informing the decision about alternative treatment. Assessment of ctDNA is often referred to as a “liquid biopsy” because of its potential to perform many of the same functions as a conventional solid tumor biopsy. Blood is not the only easily accessible material that has potential to be used to detect and monitor DNA released from solid tumor cells. Depending on the cancer, tumor DNA also may be found in stool, urine, and ascites (fluid accumulated in the abdomen in certain tumors). It is possible to detect colorectal cancer DNA in stool samples, and this is now the basis of a commercially available diagnostic test. The utility of urine DNA analysis for detection of early prostate cancer or bladder cancer is an area of active research. 
A new approach: What is immunotherapy? 
Genomics is beginning to have an impact in an entirely new form of treatment called “immunotherapy” in which a person’s immune system is used to attack the cancer. An important factor in developing cancer is the tumor’s ability to evade the immune system. Typically, when a cell develops a cancercausing mutation and becomes precancerous, the immune system recognizes that something has gone wrong with this particular cell leading to an immune response that eliminates the precancerous cells. It is very possible that many of us have 
 
 
 Cancer Treatment 43 
developed precancerous cells throughout our lives, but that our immune systems eliminated them before they ever became cancer, and, therefore, we never even knew we had them in the first place. One trick cancer cells use to evade the immune system is to erect a “shield” around themselves that essentially stops the immune system from launching its attack on them. In some tumors, cancer cells begin massively overproducing signals that essentially tell the immune system, “Do not attack me!” One key signal is the PD-L1 protein. PD-L1 sits on the surface of the cancer cells and tells the immune cells not to attack. It does this by binding to a protein on the surface of the immune cells called PD-1. Recently, it has been recognized that this mechanism for escaping the immune system is much more common in cancers than previously thought. Immunotherapy is a new major form of treatment that works by blocking the PD-L1/PD-1 shielding system that cancers use to turn off the immune response against them. After turning off those signals, the immune system is free to attack the tumor. Current immunotherapies usually block PD-1 (e.g. Nivolumab and Lambrolizumab), which essentially stops the “shut down” signal from the tumor to the immune system and allows the immune system to attack. Used in conjunction with traditional radiation and chemotherapies as well as targeted therapies, immunotherapy improves outcomes for some cancer patients. To know whether immunotherapy will be effective, it is important to identify the presence of PD-L1 in the tumor and PD-1 in the immune cells. The presence of these proteins can be determined by analyzing the RNA or searching for the protein (using histological stains). When a lot of RNA or protein for PD-L1 is detected in the tumor, we know that PD-L1 is being created in those cells and that the “do not attack” signal is being sent to the immune system. Such tumors are susceptible to this type of immunotherapy. Anti-PD-1 antibodies therapy is currently being used to treat many different types of cancer (e.g., melanoma, or kidney and lung cancer). 
 
 
 44 GENOMICS AND PERSONALIZED MEDICINE 
A related immunotherapy strategy that boosts the immune response involves CTLA-4 , a protein that sits on some of our immune cells and suppresses the attack against cancer cells. Antibodies that block CTLA-4 (e.g. ipilimumab) can hyperactivate the immune system and have proven useful for certain types of cancer (melanoma). 
How can genomics be used to harness the patient’s own immune system to fight cancer? 
Although most targeted therapies, such as immunotherapy, use information to identify when a particular therapy will be effective in a particular patient’s cancer, another exciting personalized therapeutic approach has demonstrated that strengthening the immune response against the specific tumor can be a highly effective therapeutic approach. As noted above, each patient’s cancer has its own set of unique mutations that happen by chance—most of these mutations are not driving growth of the cancer, but instead are simply passengers traveling along with the driver mutations. Although these mutations are not technically causing the cancer, pieces of the mutated proteins they create (called “neoantigens”) can be recognized by the immune system and targeted for attack. By “priming” (i.e., “vaccinating”) the patient’s immune system against passenger mutations in the tumor (using protein fragments carrying these mutations), the immune response can be magnified, facilitating a stronger attack on the cancer. Recent work has demonstrated the effectiveness of using the patient’s own immune system to fight cancer. Promising research in skin cancer and other cancer types is now revealing how neoantigen therapy can further improve therapeutic outcomes for cancer patients. Each person’s cancer has a number of unique passenger mutations. These passenger mutations can be identified through genome sequencing. It is not enough, however, to identify the mutations in the genome; the mutations must 
 
 
 Cancer Treatment 45 
also be expressed as proteins in order to create neoantigens. Analysis of gene expression patterns can be used to measure the expression of these mutations, and allow personalized neoantigen therapy to be used to further improve cancer therapy. Once neoantigens that are expressed are identified, the patient can be vaccinated against those particular neoantigens, empowering the immune system to specifically attack the cancer cells. It is expected that this type of approach, which is highly individualized based on a person’s mutations, will be extremely effective against many types of cancer and can be used in conjunction with other therapies. In addition to vaccination against personalized antigens present in cancer patients, another more generic vaccination approach has been described for prostate cancer. Ninety-five percent of prostate cancers express a protein called prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP). By boosting the immune response against PAP, a person’s immune response can be specifically tuned to target prostate cancer cells and not normal prostate cells. Thus, immune responses against generic antigens as well as neoantigens can be used to successfully target cancer cells. As with other forms of immunotherapy, these therapies can be used in conjunction with other types of treatments, thereby providing diverse avenues with which to fight cancer.

SOLVING MYSTERY DISEASES 
What is a mystery genetic disease? 
Diseases of genetic origin might cause symptoms at birth or manifest later in life. By age 25, more than 5% of the population has a disorder that has an important genetic component. Thus approximately 16 million people in the United States are affected. In many cases, the underlying genetic variant is not known. Genetic disorders that cause symptoms early in life often, but not always, are caused by a variant in a single gene. We call this type of disorder “monogenic.” Genetic disorders attributable to variants in a single gene follow predictable inheritance patterns as originally described over one hundred years ago by the father of genetics, Gregor Mendel. These disorders are often described as “Mendelian” and can be either recessive (i.e., the copies of the gene from both mother and father each carry a mutation for the disorder to be manifested) or dominant (i.e., only one defective copy of the gene is needed for the disorder to develop) (Figure 14). Sickle cell disease is an example of a Mendelian, recessive disease. Individuals who inherit the sickle variant of the hemoglobin β-globin gene HBB from both their mother and father have the characteristic sickle-shaped red blood cells (our oxygen-storing cells). This shape causes these cells to become abnormally fragile, leading to anemia (low red blood cell count and oxygen deprivation) and a host of other problems. Individuals who inherit a normal β-globin gene from 
 
 
 48 GENOMICS AND PERSONALIZED MEDICINE 
one parent and a sickle variant β-globin gene from the other parent do not have the disease, because the normal copy of the gene is sufficient to supply functional hemoglobin to red blood cells. An example of a dominant Mendelian disorder is osteogenesis imperfecta (brittle bone disease), which is most commonly due to a mutation in a gene for type 1 collagen, an important constituent of bone. Because the mutant type 1 collagen interferes with the function of normal type 1 collagen, an individual inheriting a defective gene from only one parent still exhibits the disease. At one point in time, these diseases were considered “mystery diseases,” with the genetic cause unknown; in many cases, decades of research went into discovering the causative genes.

Figure 14. Recessive and dominant mutations. Recessive mutations are those that need to be present in both gene copies for disease to arise. “Homozygous mutations” refers to when each gene copy carries the same mutation; “compound heterozygous mutations” refers to when each gene copy carries a mutation, but the mutations are different. Dominant mutations require only one copy to be mutated to cause disease. 
 
 
 Mystery Diseases 49 
Mendelian disorders may run in families (be familial), or they may arise spontaneously in the germ cells (egg and sperm cells) of the mother or father (or after the fusion of the sperm and egg) and be “de novo” to the child (i.e., not present in the mother or father outside of the germ cells). Thus, when a child with a disorder of suspected genetic origin is born to healthy parents, a spontaneous dominant variant or an inherited recessive variant are the most likely causes. Adding more complexity, disease-causing variants may vary in their “penetrance,” that is, in how frequently individuals who carry those variants manifest symptoms of the genetic disease. Highly penetrant variants cause disease in a large proportion (or even all) individuals who carry those variants. Before the current era of rapid and relatively inexpensive genome or exome sequencing, patients with mystery genetic diseases typically underwent extensive testing and inappropriate treatments before the basis of their disease was understood. It is estimated that it costs $5 million per person to manage these diseases over a person’s lifetime. Thus, prompt detection and proper diagnosis of these diseases using new DNA sequencing technologies not only ensures that the afflicted individual receives the appropriate medical care, but also helps realize an enormous savings in healthcare costs. Furthermore, patients and their families are spared unnecessary, stressful, and time-consuming testing. Although not all mystery genetic diseases are solvable using current technologies (see more below), the advent of genomics has dramatically improved success rates. 
How many Mendelian diseases are there? 
As of July 2014, approximately 7,300 Mendelian diseases have been described. For 3,963 of these, the gene that is mutated and likely responsible for the disease is known (examples are shown in Table 3). It is probable that many more Mendelian diseases will be “solved” as genomic analysis becomes more 
 
 
 50 GENOMICS AND PERSONALIZED MEDICINE 
integrated into clinical practice. For many genes, different genetic variants can have distinct effects on the encoded protein, leading to distinct disease characteristics. For example, different variants may have different effects on the amount of the encoded protein or the activity of the encoded protein. Indeed, the 3,963 unique diseases that have been solved affect only 2,776 genes because different mutations in the same gene can cause different (but often related) disease characteristics. It is probable that many more Mendelian diseases have yet to be described. There are approximately 20,000 protein-coding genes in the human genome, and variants in many of these genes would be expected to cause human disease. In addition, variants in many of the genes that encode RNAs but do not encode proteins may also lead to disease; however, these have not been studied in detail and the number of known cases is presently limited. It is likely that many more will be found. Of course, some genetic variants may be so deleterious that they result in fetal death and, therefore, will not be observed among the living population. 
How are genes responsible for genetic disorders identified? 
In general, the ease with which the genetic basis of a disorder may be determined is related to the prevalence of the diseasecausing variant(s) in the population at large, to whether there is a family history of the disorder and DNA from other family members is available for analysis, and to the mode of inheritance (e.g., Mendelian, polygenic, and/or high vs. low penetrance). For example, the cause of certain forms of hearing loss in infants is often relatively easy to determine. This is because hearing loss is relatively common in newborns (one out of every 500 children is born with hearing loss) and is, therefore, well-studied. It is known that two-thirds of hearing loss cases in newborns have a genetic basis. Most newborns with hearing loss (70%) have no other symptoms. When hearing loss is the

only genetic disorder present (i.e., there are no other symptoms), and family history suggests the disorder is being inherited in a Mendelian recessive fashion, it is commonly due to variants in one of two genes, GJB2 or GJB6. In other cases, a much larger but reasonable set of candidate genes can be analyzed. For example, regarding congenital newborn hearing loss that does not have the characteristics associated with GJB2 or GJB6 mutations, a set of up to about 100 genes may be examined for variants associated with hearing loss. Through the use of probes that target these genes, the relevant regions can be selected from patients and analyzed. This has proven to be successful in many cases. Understanding the genetic basis of hearing loss may be helpful in determining how to manage the disorder in an affected child. Also, the information may help family members make informed medical and personal decisions. Targeted approaches that screen a defined set of candidate genes for potentially deleterious variants do not reliably find the causative mutations for many diseases. For example, in inherited hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), a common cause of sudden cardiac arrest in young athletes, family members may have a strong interest in being tested to determine whether they also carry the mutation underlying this silent, devastating disease. Therefore, identification of the diseasecausing mutation is important. However, the disease-causing variant can be detected in only up to 60%–70% of inherited HCM cases using targeted approaches. Exome or whole genome sequencing often is attempted when more targeted approaches fail. Ideally, the DNA sequences for the entire family including the father, mother, and siblings are determined. Based upon the pattern of inheritance of a disease within a family, the likely genetic basis of the disease (e.g., recessive vs. dominant, familial vs. spontaneous) is deduced. This information is integrated with the results from exome or whole genome sequencing to identify genes and gene variants that might be causing the disease. The signs and symptoms that characterize a disease provide some insight into the likely 
 
 
 Mystery Diseases 53 
underlying dysfunctional biological process(es); in some cases, available basic research on a disease also helps further characterize the underlying biology. This insight into the biology of the disease can be helpful in narrowing down which of the many genes and their variants identified by the sequencing are actually causing the disease. 
How useful are genomic approaches to solving mystery genetic diseases? 
Thus far, for the vast majority of mystery genetic diseases, exome and whole genome sequencing has been successful in identifying the likely disease-causing mutations in about 25%30% of cases. Furthermore, when the causative mutation is identified, only in a handful of these cases has the information been valuable for optimizing treatment. Often whole genome sequencing or exome sequencing generates a short list of possible disease-causing mutations; narrowing the list further requires additional tests and experiments. There have been, however, a few spectacular successes. The case of Nicholas Volker offers one early example in which genome sequencing played an important role in the diagnosis and treatment of an unsolved disease. Nicholas was healthy until age two years, when he suffered a cut that would not heal. His condition dramatically worsened, and he frequently developed sepsis (infection of the blood) from many serious wounds, for which over one hundred surgeries were required. He had his colon removed, could not eat or drink, and required total parenteral nutrition (i.e., all his nutrition was administered intravenously). By sequencing his genome, doctors deduced that he had a mutation in the XIAP gene, which is associated with immune function. He received a cord blood transplant from an anonymous donor, made a remarkable recovery, and is now doing well at age six years. Another successful case is that of the non-identical (fraternal) Beery twins (Figure 15). They were born as “floppy” 
 
 
 54 GENOMICS AND PERSONALIZED MEDICINE 
babies, had seizures and delayed motor skills, and were diagnosed with cerebral palsy. Upon receiving a new diagnosis of Segawa’s dystonia, the children were treated with dopamine, which improved their health but did not completely alleviate their symptoms; indeed, their health slowly deteriorated. Finally, upon the sequencing of their genomes many years later, a mutation in both copies of the SPR gene was discovered in each of the two children. The SPR gene is involved in producing both dopamine and serotonin. This finding suggested that in addition to dopamine, serotonin supplementation might be beneficial. Administration of a serotonin precursor to the children along with dopamine significantly improved the health of each child so that they are now symptom-free. Thus, similar to the case of Nicholas Volker, in the case of the Beery twins genome sequencing provided important information that was used for effective treatment and significant health benefits.

 Mystery Diseases 55 
Unfortunately, in contrast with these examples, finding the disease-causing mutation does not lead to effective treatments in the vast majority of cases. Nonetheless, in nearly every one of the cases in which a disease-causing mutation is found, the information is still valuable to patients and their families. Finding a scientific explanation typically brings considerable relief to patients and families and provides some peace of mind. For some individuals and families, the information is helpful for planning future pregnancies. Some individuals elect to use in vitro fertilization (IVF) and genetic testing to select embryos that lack the disease-causing mutations. Embryos generated by IVF can be screened by isolating a few cells from early embryos, amplifying the DNA regions of interest from those cells, and performing DNA sequencing. Embryos lacking the disease-causing genetic mutations (or carrying at least one normal copy of the affected gene in the case of recessive mutations) are chosen for implantation. Thus, although the original genomic information may not directly benefit the person affected, it can be useful in family planning. Finally, in some cases the identification of the diseasecausing mutation might be helpful in predicting the possible course of the individual’s disease and their long-term prognosis. 
Why can’t most Mendelian diseases be solved? 
As noted above, in approximately 70%–75% of cases, the mutation(s) underlying a mystery genetic disease is or are not found. There are many likely reasons for this impasse. One important reason is that typically so many variants are present that it is difficult to narrow in on which one(s) could be causing the disease. By focusing on variants that are likely to be damaging based on their predicted effect (e.g., inactivation of a gene product), a smaller number of candidate disease-causing variants may be obtained, but the number is often still on the order of five to twenty mutations. Analyzing larger numbers of affected and unaffected family members can be useful for trimming the list of candidate 
 
 
 56 GENOMICS AND PERSONALIZED MEDICINE 
disease-causing variants further. In some cases, the clinical features of the genetic disease are suggestive of what underlying molecular mechanisms might be disrupted, and candidate disease-causing variants can be prioritized based on their known/predicted contribution to those mechanisms. Sometimes one of the candidate variants is in a gene that has been extensively studied in mice. If mutation of the mouse counterpart of the human gene results in traits similar to the genetic disease being studied, it suggests that that variant might be disease-causing. However, for patients with a small number of family members available for analysis, and for diseases with more general clinical features, such as developmental delay, it is often difficult to determine which mutation is causing the disease. A powerful way to identify the likely causative mutation in a rare disease is to compare sequencing information from two or more children whose shared symptoms suggest that they have the same disease. If the children have candidate diseasecausing variants in the same gene, there is a high probability that those variants are causative. These “recurrent” rare mutations are extremely helpful because the chances of two children with a very similar rare disease having rare damaging mutations in the same gene and those mutations not being disease-causing is very small. Even if the children do not have candidate disease-causing variants in the same gene, if they have variants in genes that have similar roles, then those variants are likely to be disease-causing. For example, many genes implicated in hearing loss contribute to inner ear structure and many genes implicated in cardiomyopathy contribute to the structure of cardiac muscle. If predicted deleterious mutations are found in genes that operate in the inner ear or in cardiomyocytes (which make up the heart muscle), respectively, these might be the likely culprit. In an interesting example of the power of using recurrent mutations to determine the cause of a childhood disease, we 
 
 
 Mystery Diseases 57 
sequenced the DNA of a child with developmental delays and other problems, and her two unaffected parents (Figure 16). The parents had been searching for years to find out what was wrong with their child. After narrowing the list to eight possible mutations, it was unclear which one caused the disease. A second family across the country reported their child with a similar disease and a damaging mutation in one of the eight possible genes (NGLY1). The match was made and the disease solved!

of dedicated family members and the importance of sharing information. In addition to the complexity of sorting through many candidate gene variants, a mystery genetic disease may remain unsolved because no variants were found in the first place. Current sequencing technologies do not cover 100% of the genome. Moreover, different sequencing approaches have different limitations. Exome sequencing analyzes the protein-coding region of the genome, which represents 1%–2% of genomic DNA, hence variants that affect nonprotein coding DNA (e.g., DNA that functions in regulating the expression of a particular gene) are not detected. Also, copy number variations (i.e., whether extra copies of a gene are present) and other structural variations are more difficult to detect with exome sequencing; whole genome sequencing is better for detecting such variants. Exome sequencing, however, targets protein coding regions at much greater coverage than whole genome sequencing (i.e., each base is sequenced an average of more than 80 times for exome sequence vs. an average of 30 times for whole genome) thus, providing greater sensitivity for detecting variants within coding regions.

COMPLEX GENETIC DISEASES 
What is a complex genetic disease? 
Although great strides have been made to identify single gene variants that have a strong causative effect for a particular disease (e.g., CFTR mutations for cystic fibrosis and HEXA mutations for Tay-Sachs disease), the number of individuals who carry such deleterious genetic variants is overall quite small. More often, single gene changes have only a subtle effect on disease and for most common diseases it is thought that either multiple genetic changes in an individual and/or genetic changes in conjunction with environmental factors cause disease. In contrast to monogenic disorders (also called Mendelian), we refer to those affected by many factors as complex genetic diseases. Examples of complex genetic diseases include type 2 diabetes, autism, schizophrenia, Alzheimer’s disease, coronary artery disease and depression. Our understanding of which genes and environmental factors contribute to a complex disease and how much they contribute to a disease is generally limited. Because the data are incomplete and subject to some interpretation, depending on which institution or company is performing a risk analysis, different genetic risk factors may be weighted more or less (or not at all) in calculating a person’s overall risk for a particular complex disease. Furthermore, how individual risk factors interact (i.e., whether their effects are independent of each 
 
 
 60 GENOMICS AND PERSONALIZED MEDICINE 
other, synergistic, or antagonistic) is generally poorly understood. Although imperfect, in the absence of more complete information, a simple additive model (based on the assumption that risk factors have entirely independent effects on disease risk) is often used in determining an individual’s combined genetic score for complex genetic diseases (see example in Figure 17). For complex genetic diseases, the next frontier in modern genomic medicine is the identification of all factors (both genetic and environemental) of small effect that contribute to an individual’s disease and elucidation of how these factors interact.

The triangle is the starting point, that is, estimated risk for acquiring this disease in their lifetime based on the subject’s ethnic group, in the absence of genome sequence information. By accounting for genetic variant information, increased risk is represented by a bar extending to the right and decreased risk by a bar extending to the left. Thus, this individual is at higher risk for hypertriglyceridemia and type 2 diabetes (the patient has both of these conditions), and decreased risk for obesity (the patient is of normal body mass index). Note that this is a partial list of results. This figure extends to over one hundred common diseases. 
 
 
 Complex Diseases 61 
How does complex genetics affect neurological diseases? 
Many neurological diseases are complex genetic diseases. Examples include autism, schizophrenia, depression, bipolar disorder, and late onset Alzheimer’s disease. That multiple genes are involved in these disorders likely reflects the complex biological processes that underlie human behavior and cognition. There may be many ways to perturb these processes genetically and environmentally, and, at the same time, there may be many compensatory mechanisms in place that help mask the effect of perturbations. Thus, no one individual factor causes the disease by itself, and multiple factors together contribute to the disease. Genetic mapping studies, and more recently exome sequencing and genetic tests to search for copy number variation, have been used to help identify genes involved in various neurological diseases. Many thousands of individuals with autism or schizophrenia, along with their family members, have had their DNA analyzed. A number of genes have been identified that appear to contain an increased number of mutations in certain neurological diseases. Thus far, over 370 candidate genes have been implicated in autism and over 200 in schizophrenia. It has also been discovered that gene copy number variations may contribute to disease and that gene dosage may be an important contributor to autism. Many of the genes that have been implicated in autism and schizophrenia are involved in synaptic functions; synapses are the junctions through which nerve cells communicate with one another and thus are important for proper functioning of the brain. Interestingly, many of the genetic loci implicated in autism and schizophrenia overlap, suggesting that these two diseases have some common features. Much effort is underway to identify additional biological pathways associated with each of these diseases. Recently, research from the author’s laboratory utilized a novel approach to identify a molecular network underlying autism spectrum disorders. Essentially, existing information 
 
 
 62 GENOMICS AND PERSONALIZED MEDICINE 
about which proteins like to work together through their physical interactions was used to create an “interactome map.” Genes previously implicated in autism were located onto this interactome and many of them mapped onto a particular molecular network or module. The expression pattern of the genes in this autism module was predicted by consulting a brain atlas that details which genes are expressed where in the brain. In addition to cortical neurons, the autism module genes are largely expressed in the corpus callosum and oligodendrocyte cells, a region of the brain and type of cell not usually considered to be linked to autism. Thus, this novel integrated omics approach suggested a molecular network (rather than just a gene or genes) underlying a complex disease and provided insight into how it functions. It also offered a new approach that can be used to help decipher other complex genetic disorders. Although extensive effort has been devoted to understanding the genetic basis of neurological diseases, as with other complex diseases, to date there is not a strong predictive genetic test to help identify individuals at high risk. If we had this information, we might be able to screen subjects at high risk and detect disease earlier—and possibly improve outcomes with early intervention. In fact, despite the large number of genes that have been implicated in complex neurological diseases, less than 10% of the genetic or other factors underlying any of these diseases have been identified. It is likely that additional genes remain to be discovered. Furthermore, combinatorial effects of multiple genes (i.e., gene–gene interactions) and gene–environment interactions contribute to many complex diseases, and integrating these factors into the determination of disease risk is in its infancy. 
How does complex genetics affect metabolic diseases? 
Complex metabolic diseases such as diabetes and obesity affect a staggering percentage of the population and a great 
 
 
 Complex Diseases 63 
deal of scientific effort is being devoted to unraveling the complex interplay of genes and environment that cause such diseases. The onset of type 1 diabetes is often in childhood or young adulthood and involves the loss of beta islet cells that produce insulin; genes that have been implicated are involved in immune function (e.g., HLA) and beta cell function. Patients with type 1 diabetes often produce antibodies that target and attack proteins on the beta islet cells, thus contributing to beta cell loss. Type 2 diabetes is caused by progressively increasing dysfunction in the body’s response to the glucose-regulating factor, insulin. Although type 2 diabetes is strongly linked to obesity, there are significant genetic factors at play. Not all obese individuals will develop type 2 diabetes, while many lean individuals will develop the disease, and we currently have a poor understanding of what makes these individuals unique. Obesity itself is highly complex, and although diet and exercise are clearly contributing factors, recent research has implicated genetic factors and even the composition of the microbial population in the gut. A third, less common form of diabetes exists and is referred to as MODY for Maturity Onset of Diabetes in the Young. It is often linked to mutations in one of a small number of genes (~10) that can cause disease by reducing the ability of the pancreas to produce insulin. MODY is monogenic and is not a complex genetic disease. Large genetic mapping studies spanning thousands of people have been performed for analyzing type 1 and type 2 diabetes, obesity, and other disorders such as elevated cholesterol. These have identified over one hundred genes associated with these various diseases. As with complex neurological disorders, in each case, although many genes have been identified, the genetic contribution of these genes in total is estimated to be 10%–20%, depending upon the disease. Thus, additional genes remain to be discovered. Importantly for each of the diseases, environmental factors and pathogen infections contribute to the disease, as described later in the gene–environment and infectious disease chapters. Thus, it is likely that gene–gene 
 
 
 64 GENOMICS AND PERSONALIZED MEDICINE 
and gene–environment interactions contribute to each of these diseases. Overall, because of the myriad of factors that contribute to complex diseases, each person will have his/her own risk for these diseases, based on his/her personal genetic and environmental contributions. 
Can some diseases be both monogenic and complex? 
It should be noted that for many, and probably most diseases, there is a spectrum of genetic causes from monogenic/ Mendelian to complex. That is, some highly penetrant variants can be strongly associated with a disease, along with other variants of low effect. Examples include cancer, Alzheimer’s disease, and heart diseases in which both monogenic and complex forms occur in different families. These forms can have different disease effects. Take as an example Alzheimer’s disease. There are early onset cases in which particular variants in the APP or presenilin-1 or 2 genes almost always cause familial forms of the disease. That is, if a family member has the disease and the child gets the same variants, there is a good chance the child will develop Alzheimer’s disease at a relatively young age. For late onset Alzheimer’s, the situation is more complex. One major gene associated with late onset Alzheimer’s is the apolipoprotein E gene (APOE). Twenty-five to thirty percent of the population has a variant called ApoE4 that is commonly associated with the disease. (Males without this mutation have a 17% chance of acquiring the disease; those with one copy have a 25% chance; and those with both copies mutated have a 60% chance.) Although the ApoE4 allele is present in about 40% of people who have Alzheimer’s, it is not the only factor responsible for the disease, because many people who have two copies of this allele do not develop the disease, and similarly, many others who get the disease do not have the ApoE4 allele. Thus, other genetic and environmental factors contribute to late onset Alzheimer’s, and many other genetic loci of 
 
 
 Complex Diseases 65 
lower effect have been identified. Interestingly, in regards to ApoE, there are also alleles that are protective (ApoE2) and reduce the chances of getting Alzheimer’s. Thus, mutations in various genes can cause familial disease, and major and minor genetic risk factors exist. Two other examples of complex diseases or syndromes with a major genetic component—as well as other minor alleles—are age-related macular degeneration and autism. Age-related macular degeneration results in blindness, and one major locus (HTRAX) accounts for approximately one-half of genetic cases. For autism, there are mutations that cause strong autism-like effects in children (e.g., Rett syndrome and Angelman syndrome in children, which have mutations in the MECP2 and UBE3A genes, respectively). There are also many other mutations that likely do not cause the disorder by themselves but likely do so in conjunction with other genetic mutations or environmental factors. Thus, overall, for most diseases there is likely to be a spectrum of risk genes, stretching from those that give very strong effects to those that result in much weaker ones.

PHARMACOGENOMICS 
How can your genome directly help guide drug treatments for treating disease? 
As noted earlier, genomics can have a direct impact on drug treatments for cancer and mystery diseases. In a patient with cancer, it may be possible to use that patient’s DNA sequence to guide treatment to chemotherapy or to target pathways that are genetically (or epigenetically, as we will discuss later) affected in the patient. The same is true in rare cases for undiagnosed diseases—treatments can be matched to genomic information as in the case of the Beery twins described previously. 
What are other ways your DNA can guide drug treatments? 
Our DNA also affects drug metabolism, side effects, and drugdrug interactions. This information can be extremely valuable because a wrong drug dose or dangerous side effect can have life-threatening consequences. This area has been studied extensively, and to date there are several hundred identified genes that affect drug response. Many of these genes encode proteins such as the cytochrome P450s, which normally modify natural compounds to make hormones or help remove toxins in our bodies. We have 80 CYP genes encoding cytochrome P450s in our genome. These proteins affect the metabolism of drugs we take, either by directly modifying the drug, or by modifying prodrugs (precursors to drugs) that are administered to patients, and thus affect the amount of drug that is available to 
 
 
 68 GENOMICS AND PERSONALIZED MEDICINE 
act in the body. Other genes that affect drug response encode transporters that either deliver drugs into our cells in order for them to work or evict them from the cell so they cannot reach their intended target. One of the best studied cases of genes affecting drug dose is that of warfarin (also known as Coumadin). Warfarin is an anticlotting agent that is administered to patients with existing or heightened risk of forming clots in their vasculature or to prevent clot formation in their hearts due to cardiac arrhythmias or mechanical valve replacements. The metabolism of warfarin is affected by two genes, VKORC1 and CYP2C9. The -1639G>A SNV in the promoter of the former leads to less protein produced, and so less warfarin is required to thin patients’ blood adequately. For CYP2C9, the variant forms CYP2C9*3 (I359L) and CYP2C9*2 (R144C), metabolize the drug more slowly; patients with these variants are also typically administered lower doses. Thus, genetic screening should theoretically be useful for administering the proper drug amount and help reduce morbidity and mortality from excessive blood thinning and consequent uncontrollable bleeding. Another example is tamoxifen, which is used for treatment of endocrine responsive breast cancer. Tamoxifen is given to patients postsurgery and dramatically reduces the rate of cancer recurrence. This drug is metabolized by cytochrome P450 2D6, the product of the CYP2D6 gene. Based on their DNA, there are patients with little CYP2D6 activity who are poor metabolizers and others with high activity who are extensive metabolizers. An FDA-approved genetic test exists for finding the variants of the CYP2D6 gene to help guide tamoxifen administration, but the lack of study data demonstrating its role in improving patient outcomes has, to date, led insurance companies to refuse to cover the test. Beyond having ramifications for drug efficacy, genetics also may play a role in the side effects of drugs. Many patients with atherosclerosis take statin drugs. A known but relatively 
 
 
 Pharmacogenomics 69 
rare side effect of this class of agents is a sensation of muscle burning (myalgia) due to muscle breakdown (rhabdomyolysis). Multiple mutations have been found that modulate one’s susceptibility to this particular adverse effect. One mutation appears to be specific for a certain, widely used statin drug, so a patient’s genetic information could, in theory, be used to choose which drug he/she should take. Interestingly, the medical society’s approach to these findings has been to recommend against placing any new patients on the highest doses of this statin, an across-the-board solution that otherwise could be individualized with genetic information. It is important to note that nearly all drugs have side effects. Thus, altering doses often goes hand in hand with altering side effects. For these reasons, it is useful to incrementally increase the drug dose to the optimal level for therapeutic response, but not so high as to cause unwanted side effects. Finally, though it seems obvious that drug choice and dosing can and, therefore, should be tailored to a person’s genomic sequence, there are presently few trials that substantiate the benefits of genetic testing for drug treatments. Furthermore, even in the most obvious cases for which the benefits should be evident, such as with warfarin, the trials sometimes do not support the value of genetic testing. The reason for this present situation is not clear, but how the trials were performed may have played a role. 
Are there sex differences in drug effects? 
A major genetic difference present in all populations is the one responsible for dividing individuals into the two sexes. Men and women express different drug metabolism enzymes at different levels; that is, many cytochrome P450s are differentially expressed in the liver or kidneys of men and women. In addition, men and women have different body masses. Therefore, it is not surprising that men and women often react differently to drugs. Antihypertensive, antipsychotic, and antidepressant

GENOMICS FOR THE 
HEALTHY PERSON 
Would knowing your genome affect the disease you might get, the job you choose, the sports you play, and the food you eat? Here we explore the role of knowing your genome sequence if you are healthy. 
How can getting your genome sequenced improve your health? 
Although genomics can be useful for people with diseases, can it be useful for the healthy person? Many people believe that the answer is no. They feel it is too hard to predict disease risk from this information and raise concerns about the accuracy of both the technology and interpretation. They also worry that people will receive the information and worry excessively about their potential disease risk. Others, however, have a different opinion. They feel that useful information can be extracted from a person’s genome, and that this can be used to help guide a person’s health care. A compelling argument is that family history is widely used in medical care. Based on family history, people are commonly placed on the alert for certain diseases, and diet and physical activity programs are often recommended. Shouldn’t a person’s genome sequence be better than family history? The answer is certainly, “Yes,” even if we are not perfect at interpreting a person’s genome. We all have a multitude of 
 
 
 72 GENOMICS AND PERSONALIZED MEDICINE 
variants in our DNA, many of which may cause disease—that is to say no one has the perfect genome. In fact, we all have at least 100 variants that cause a gene to be inactivated, although in the majority of these cases a good copy still exists. Methods have been established to analyze a person’s genome to find mutations that are predictive of disease. A version we use is summarized in Figure 18. By analyzing a person’s genome in detail we find several types of mutations: 
(a) Those that are in a gene that previously has been shown to cause disease at very high occurrence. Furthermore, the actual mutation is very likely to interfere with the normal function of the gene and cause a disease. The genome is searched for all variants that cause disease at high frequency. Particular attention is devoted to variants in genes that may cause disease based on a person’s family history, (b) Those that lie in a gene known to cause a disease, but the mutations are new or rare. Computer algorithms suggest the mutation may be damaging, but it is unclear whether these mutations are disease-causing. These mutations are called “variants of unknown significance” (or VUSes). (c) “Carrier mutations” in which the mutation itself is unlikely to cause disease but could be passed on to cause disease in a person’s children and grandchildren (e.g., recessive trait or lowly penetrant dominant one). (d) Pharmacogenetic variants, which predict the individual’s response to the level of a drug or potential adverse side effect for a particular drug (discussed earlier in Chapter7). (e) Finally, it is possible to estimate the risk of complex diseases by aggregating the individual contributions of the many genetic loci that have been associated to the disease. This analysis forms the Risk-O-Gram described earlier. 
Examples of mutations that lead to disease with very high frequency are known disease-causing mutations in the BRCA1, 
 
 
 Genomics for the Healthy Person 73 
BRCA2, and SHDB genes and the early Alzheimer’s genes (e.g., APP, presenilins). For BRCA1 and BRCA2, there are many known disease-causing mutations in these genes; women harboring these variants have a greater than 80% chance of developing breast or ovarian cancer. For mutations in SHDB, there is a high chance of developing paraganglioma. Although one might think that these mutations should be evident from a person’s family history, this is not always the case. In fact, in a recent study that we performed, a woman who did not have a family history of breast cancer was identified with an inactivating mutation in BRCA1. Although the reason for this is not clear; it is possible that she inherited the mutation from her father who is less susceptible to the disease or the mutation is

Figure 18. Strategy for analyzing a healthy person’s genome. Variants identified by genome sequencing are analyzed for those that (a) reside in genes in which mutation in just one gene copy can cause disease; (b) are passed on to children and when combined with a mutation in the second gene copy may cause disease; (c) may affect response to certain drugs; and (d) have small effect but in aggregate with other changes can be associated with complex disease. For scenario a and b, sometimes the variants are “known” to be associated with disease and sometimes they occur in the same gene but are new and their significance in causing disease is not clear. These variants of unknown significance (VUS) can be difficult to interpret. 
 
 
 74 GENOMICS AND PERSONALIZED MEDICINE 
“de novo.” This person learned about the mutation from her genome sequence and had surgery based on that information. She would not have known about this mutation had she not had her genome sequenced. In addition to the BRCA, SHDB, and Alzheimer’s disease genes, many other mutations are highly predictive of diseases. The American College of Medical Genetics has identified 56 genes for which it is recommended that known diseasecausing mutations from a sequencing study be reported back to the subject’s physician, who, in turn, can consult with the patients based on their wishes. This list can be easily expanded to include many more genes with known disease-causing mutations and will continue to grow as more disease-causing mutations are found. “Variants of unknown significance” (VUS) is the second category of mutation. Our work indicates that people typically have one to three of these that might directly contribute to disease, and the number is even higher if carrier status is considered. It is difficult to know whether these mutations will cause disease. Their identification, however, can lead to follow-up tests that can determine whether the person might be likely to acquire this disease. For example, in the author’s genome, a variant in a TERT gene suggested that he may be susceptible to aplastic anemia, a loss of blood cells. The activity of the gene (which adds sequences to the ends of chromosomes) and levels of blood cells were analyzed in subsequent tests. The subject was found to have slightly shorter sequences on the ends of his chromosomes; however, his levels of blood cells have been normal and thus, do not currently manifest disease symptoms. For diseases that are associated with increased age, patients who have VUS can be on guard for acquisition of these diseases. Finally, it is possible to infer risk of complex diseases from variants of low effect. In most cases, these may increase a person’s risk from a very low value, such as 0.1% to a higher, but still overall low value, such as 1%. Although this is a 10-fold 
 
 
 Genomics for the Healthy Person 75 
increase, the person is still at very low risk for developing the disease. Presently, the accuracy of these tests is difficult to ascertain. However, they often match family history. Moreover, in the author’s case a prediction was made that proved to be accurate. My genome sequence predicted that I am at risk for type 2 diabetes, a condition not known to run in my family. I acquired the disease after a respiratory infection, and because of awareness of my genetic predisposition, detected it early and successfully managed it, at least initially (Figure 19). Like VUSes, complex disease risk can be a useful prognostic indicator of diseases for which to be on the alert, much like family history. Genome sequencing for the healthy person already has been shown to have value in a number of cases: for predicting disease risk, catching disease early, and avoiding drugs that may lead to adverse side effects. As such, it can help facilitate a shift in the way medicine is currently practiced, from treatment after manifestation of the disease to taking a more

 76 GENOMICS AND PERSONALIZED MEDICINE 
preventative approach. Moreover, as our interpretation of the genome improves, the value of genome sequencing will continue to increase further. 
Can genome sequencing affect the drugs someone takes? 
Even if a person is generally healthy, he or she may take medications on occasion or even regularly. As an example, a young woman had her genome sequenced and was found to have a variant that put her at risk for thrombosis. Based on this information, it is recommended that she should avoid certain oral contraceptives. In a second example, an individual with heart palpitations was found to have a variant responsible for an aberrancy in the electrical properties of the heart called long QT syndrome. It is recommended that this individual avoid certain drugs in the future, including some commonly prescribed antibiotics. Because we already know so much about the genetic effects on drug responses, much more can be learned about drug dosages and what drugs a person should avoid. Analysis of the genomes of a number of people reveals that a person’s genome sequence typically has valuable information regarding about three to six drugs (Table 5). As an example, analysis of the author’s genome revealed useful information about several drugs related to type 2 diabetes: metformin, a widely used diabetes drug, and troglitazone, which is no longer prescribed in the United States. Both these medications were predicted to have a greater effect than would be expected for the average patient. The genome sequence also revealed useful information about statins that should not used so as to avoid side effects. Finally, it revealed the previously mentioned VKORC1-1639G>A mutation, which increases the blood thinning effects of warfarin. Although it is possible that some or none of these drugs will ever be used, the information may be valuable in the future.

Can genetic testing be used to predict sports performance and injuries? 
Genetic loci have been associated with sports performance and injuries. Physical endurance, strength, and other building blocks of athleticism are complex traits to which genetic loci have been associated. A gene that directly affects contractile muscle, alpha-actinin-3 (ACTN3), may affect strength, and variants in this gene have been associated with sprinters. Genes involved in energy utilization and hypoxia (i.e., the lack of oxygen) have been shown to be associated with physical endurance. Many of them affect metabolic and mitochondrial function. These findings are not unexpected, given that mitochondria are involved in energy utilization and production. Examples of “endurance genes” include the PPAR-delta gene, which encodes a key regulator involved in energy utilization in which a variant (294T/C) has been associated with endurance; GYS1, which gives rise to a skeletal muscle glycogen synthase; and the beta2-adrenergic receptor gene. Similarly, variants in genes associated with hypoxia, a response to low oxygen, have been associated with endurance as well. Presumably, these variants affect efficient energy utilization and oxygen consumption in muscles subjected to long periods of use. Genetic traits also have been associated with sports injuries. Tendon disorders have been associated with blood groups and collagen genes (a structural component of tendons), and collagen variants have been associated with propensities for ligament tears. Individuals at risk for cardiomyopathy can potentially die from physical exertion—indeed, in a high profile case, a rising star for the Boston Celtics, Reggie Lewis, died during practice and was diagnosed with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a disease known to have a genetic basis. Recently, concerns have been raised about head blows in football and boxing as causes for Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases. The advantages of screening for those at risk for such conditions seems obvious; those at risk for injury or death might 
 
 
 Genomics for the Healthy Person 79 
choose not to pursue such recreational or career activities, or they might modify their training to minimize their risk. Many individuals who desire to pursue these activities, however, may opt out of testing for fear they could not then pursue them. 
Will sequencing my genome affect my children and my relatives? 
We all have genetic mutations, and your genome sequence will reveal them. It not only predicts your risk for disease, but indirectly affects your relatives as well. Your children will inherit one half of your damaging variants from you and another half from your spouse (which half is not known, but it can be tested). Likewise you share half of your DNA with that of your biological brothers and sisters and half with your mother and father. Thus, what you learn about you provides some information about disease risk for other related family members. In this sense, it is very much like family history, in which genetic diseases run in families due to shared DNA. It is important to note, however, that a child’s risk for a particular genetic disease is not identical to that of his or her parent because only part of the genetic information is shared between parents and their children. The genetic predisposition loci randomly pass to children so the child may not get the mutation. Thus, just because a parent has a genetic disease does not mean the child will get the disease. A good example is the BRCA1 mutation. If a mother has this mutation, there is a 50% chance her children will inherit it. Thus, the chance is greater than the population as a whole (normally present in about 1 in every 400 people) but not a certainty.

PRENATAL TESTING 
How are genome sequencing technologies changing prenatal testing? 
One area where genomics is revolutionizing current practice is prenatal DNAtesting. Prenatal DNAtesting is a common practice used to monitor whether fetuses may have abnormal chromosome numbers (aneuploidy), which occurs about once in every 160 live births. It can also be used to identify mutations in genes. Prenatal DNA testing is commonly used when the chances of genetic abnormalities are high due to family history or advanced maternal age (e.g., greater than 35 years). Down, Edwards, and Patau syndromes are examples of having extra copies of chromosome 21, 18, and 13, respectively, and are the most common autosomal aneuploidies. Turner syndrome results from the lack of the second copy of X chromosome in women. The consequences of aneuploidies vary widely among the various syndromes and with the affected person but can include intellectual disability, congenital heart defects, and infertility, among others. Until relatively recently, nearly all prenatal testing was performed by amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling (CVS). During amniocentesis, a needle is used to collect fluid harboring fetal cells from the amniotic fluid surrounding the fetus whereas CVS samples the placenta. The cells are then analyzed for alterations in chromosome number or structure. Both of these tests are invasive, however, and carry a risk, albeit low, of miscarriage. 
 
 
 82 GENOMICS AND PERSONALIZED MEDICINE 
A more recent test involving genomics, noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT), is now revolutionizing genetic testing of the fetus. It has been known for some time that fetal cells circulate in the mother’s blood; later it was discovered that fetal DNA also can be found in the mother’s blood. The amount is very low in early pregnancy—approximately 3%–4% of the cell-free DNA in the blood is derived from the fetus at five weeks, and the fraction rises to 10%–15% by the eighth month of pregnancy. With the advent of high-throughput sequencing, it is now possible to analyze the fetal DNA from the maternal blood—the paternal sequence in the fetal DNA has variants that are distinct from the maternal DNA. Originally, this approach was established to identify copy number variations (CNVs). Detection of CNVs is particularly important because births with aneuploidies are quite common, and duplication or deletion of genes can have developmental and/or health consequences. The aforementioned aneuploidies are relatively easy to detect using high throughput sequencing (Figure 20). In fact, a prenatal diagnostic test has recently been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for detecting

 Prenatal Testing 83 
trisomies of chromosomes 21, 18, and 13 in a mother’s blood. The method is highly accurate and has a sensitivity of greater than 99% with few false positives. Smaller chromosome abnormalities also can be detected with this technology, although such tests are not yet approved by the FDA. The advantage of noninvasive fetal DNA testing is that it is very simple and can be performed using blood drawn during a routine prenatal checkup. It is only a matter of time before this test will be available for all pregnant women and may become routine. It is likely that some women may decline the noninvasive fetal DNA test, but it is easy to envision that a large number of parents will opt for the test to gain insight into their child’s likelihood of having a severe genetic disease. 
Can genome sequencing be used to identify other mutations, beyond chromosomal abnormalities, that might cause disease? 
With the higher sensitivity and lower cost of high-throughput sequencing, it is now possible to determine the whole genome sequence of a fetus before it is born. Although it is likely that genome sequencing of fetal DNA obtained from the mother’s blood would be less accurate than that of fetal DNA from the fetus itself, prenatal genome sequencing nonetheless provides an opportunity to noninvasively predict disease risk before a child is born. The issues this testing raises are similar to those raised above for any healthy person, but there are also important differences. One significant difference in prenatal screening compared with newborn, child, or adult genetic screening is that parents can choose to terminate the pregnancy. As discussed in more depth later, several ethical issues arise: What level of confidence is required for prenatal screening in order to terminate a pregnancy? Is it appropriate to screen for and act upon nondisease conditions, such as height or hair color? Even if the fetus is diagnosed with a disease risk and the parents decide to continue with the pregnancy, the knowledge of the disease risk might affect the manner in which the parents treat 
 
 
 84 GENOMICS AND PERSONALIZED MEDICINE 
or behave around the child after birth. Parents may become overly concerned or overly protective if they believe their child is at risk for particular conditions. In some cases this behavior may prove beneficial, but in other cases, overprotective behavior may be harmful. 
Can genetic testing be useful for choosing healthier embryos and producing designer babies? 
In addition to prenatal genome sequencing, it is now possible to analyze the DNA of early embryos, before the embryo even implants into the mother’s uterus. Specifically, after in vitro fertilization (IVF), a small number of cells (~1–6) can be removed from early embryos and analyzed by genetic tests. This procedure can be performed by biopsying an 8-cell embryo at the third day after fertilization or the trophectoderm of a blastocyst at the fifth day. In the United States, embryo biopsy typically occurs at the fifth day. Typically, only one or a handful of genes are assayed. Presently, genetic testing of embryos is only performed in several circumstances. In cases in which a child is born with a severe genetic disease, parents often turn to IVF and embryo testing to avoid having a second child with the same disease. Similarly, if the parents are genetic carriers of a particular disease and they want to ensure that their child is not born with the genetic disease, they may chose IVF screening. IVF is often used to help solve infertility problems, and such embryos can be screened for aneuploidy. Indeed, although some aneuploid embryos can develop and result in live births, most aneuploid embryos are not implanted and many would naturally miscarry. By screening for embryos with the normal numbers of chromosomes, the success rate of IVF can be increased, along with the likelihood of having children without genetic diseases caused by aneuploidy. Because it is now possible to determine the genome sequence of DNA from one or a few cells (albeit not yet with perfect 
 
 
 Prenatal Testing 85 
accuracy or completeness), we can now determine the entire genome sequence of IVF embryos before they are implanted. Could we see a world in which most babies are born after screening in vitro fertilized embryos and those lacking obvious disease-causing variants are implanted into the mother? It is certainly possible and perhaps even likely. This ability to select genetically screened progeny also raises issues about selecting characteristics that are not associated with human disease, such as eye color, height, athletic ability, intelligence, and additional traits as they become better understood. These possibilities, which raise ethical concerns about how genetic information will be used, are discussed later. It is also possible, in principle, to modify embryos by inserting or modifying genetic material. This has been performed in mice or other mammals for research purposes; genes have been inserted to fix genetic defects (e.g., cystic fibrosis in mice) or enhance traits (e.g., to produce transgenic livestock). A “reporter” gene has even been inserted into the embryos of chimpanzees. These technologies raise the prospect that it might be possible to not only select desired embryos for implantation, but to also modify them to correct disease or enhance traits before a child is born.
