NCCN Guidelines Index Table of Contents Discussion

Updates in Version 1.2022 of the NCCN Guidelines for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer from Version 7.2021 include: NSCL-13 • Pretreatment Evaluation Molecular testing changed to Biomarker testing (also applies to NSCL-14) NSCL-18 • Establish histologic subtype with adequate tissue for molecular testing (consider rebiopsy or plasma testing if appropriate) • Footnote nn modified: The NCCN NSCLC Guidelines Panel strongly advises broader molecular profiling with the goal of identifying rare
driver mutations for which effective drugs may already be available, or to appropriately counsel patients regarding the availability of clinical trials. Broad molecular profiling is defined as molecular testing that identifies all biomarkers identified in NSCL-19 in either a single assay or a combination of a limited number of assays, and optimally also identifies emerging biomarkers (NSCL-I). Tiered approaches based on low prevalence of co-occurring biomarkers are acceptable.

NSCL-21 • Footnote ww modified: Consider a biopsy at time of progression to rule out SCLC transformation and evaluate mechanisms of resistance. (also applies to NSCL-22) • Footnote yy modified: The data in the second-line setting suggest that PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor monotherapy is less effective, irrespective of PDL1 expression, in EGFR exon 19 deletion or L858R, ALK+ NSCLC. (also applies to NSCL-22, NSCL-27, NSCL-28) NSCL-22 • T790M testing: category 1 added • Subsequent therapy specifically noted for T790M• Footnote zz modified: Plasma or tissue-based testing via broad molecular profiling should be considered at progression, on EGFR TKIs for the T790M mutation and other genomic resistance mechanisms. If plasma-based testing is negative, tissue-based testing with rebiopsy material is strongly recommended. Practitioners may want to consider scheduling the biopsy concurrently with plasma testing referral. NSCL-23 • New page added with treatment recommendations for EGFR S768I, L861Q, and/or G719X NSCL-24 • Footnotes ccc and eee modified: high-risk added (also applies to NSCL-25, NSCL-37, NSCL-J) NSCL-27 • Lorlatinib added for ALK G1202R • Limited metastases: Therapy for multiple lesions added as an option (also applies to NSCL-28, NSCL-30) • Footnote zz added: Plasma or tissue-based testing via broad molecular profiling should be considered at progression for genomic resistance mechanisms.

chemotherapy is used in the other 50%two-thirds.

• Data from the updated questionnaire (2021) included regarding the approach to patients with N2 disease at the NCCN Member Institutions

All NCCN institutions treat select N2 patients with multimodality therapy that includes surgery.

The majority of NCCN institutions prefer EBUS for initial mediastinal staging, reserving mediastinoscopy for possible restaging.

The majority of institutions do not pathologically restage mediastinal lymph nodes after induction therapy and prior to surgery.

All NCCN institutions consider surgery for single-station non-bulky N2 disease.

Approximately half of the institutions consider surgery for single-station bulky disease, 39% for multi-station non-bulky disease, and 21%

for multi-station bulky disease.

Two-thirds of institutions prefer induction chemotherapy; one-third prefer chemoradiation.

The majority require at least stable disease after induction, but do not require radiologic or pathologic response prior to surgery.

Roughly a half would consider pneumonectomy after induction chemotherapy, but less than a quarter would consider pneumonectomy

after chemoradiation.

Approximately three-fourths would give adjuvant RT for positive residual N2 disease, but only approximately one-fourth would give RT for

N2 pathologic complete response.

Bullet 3 modified: If an interventional radiologist or center is uncertain about the feasibility or safety of IGTA or the use of IGTA for radiation

failure, consider obtaining an additional interventional radiology opinion from a high-volume specialized center.

• Ablation for NSCLC

Bullet 3 added: Like surgery, pneumothorax may occur after IGTA, particularly if multiple lesions are treated in a single session.

Pneumothorax has been reported in 18.7%–45.7% of IGTA cases. Self-limited pneumothorax, not requiring chest tube placement, is an

expected event and not considered a complication unless escalation of care is required. In 20.7% of IGTA cases, chest tube insertion may

be required.

Four-year survival with durvalumab after chemoradiotherapy in stage III NSCLCan update from the PACIFIC trial. J Thorac Oncol 2021;16:860-867. NSCL-H 1 of 7 • Bullet 3: Tissue Specimen Acquisition and Management Sub-bullet 2 modified: A major limitation in obtaining tissue molecular testing results for NSCLC occurs when minimally invasive
techniques are used to obtain samples. Sub-bullet 3 modified: When tissue is minimal, laboratories should deploy techniques to maximize tissue for molecular and ancillary
testing, including dedicated histology protocols for small biopsies, including “up-front” slide sectioning for diagnostic and predictive testing. Peripheral blood (plasma circulating tumor DNA) can be a surrogate sample (NSCL-H 7 of 7). NSCL-H 2 of 7 • Testing Methodologies New entry under diamond 2: Broad molecular profiling is defined as molecular testing that identifies all biomarkers identified in NSCL-19 in either a single assay or a combination of a limited number of assays, and optimally also identifies emerging biomarkers (NSCL-I). Tiered approaches based on low prevalence of co-occurring biomarkers are acceptable. Diamond 5 added: Any method that interrogates sequences other than a subset of highly specific alterations (eg, NGS, Sanger) has the potential to identify variants of uncertain significance (VUS). Any variant classified as a VUS, even if in a gene in which other variants are clinically actionable, should not be considered as a basis for targeted therapy selection. Diamond removed: IHC is specifically utilized for some specific analytes, and can be a useful surrogate or screening assay for others. NSCL-H 3 of 7 • Bullet 1: Molecular Targets for Analysis Sub-bullet 2: EGFR Gene Mutations ◊ Diamond 2 updated: Molecular testing for EGFR mutations to should be performed when adjuvant TKI therapy is a consideration for
NSCLC stage IB-IIIA. While the testing process may be technically easier on a resected specimen, initial diagnostic biopsy specimens are also acceptable for testing for this indication. on diagnostic biopsy or surgical resection sample to ensure the EGFR mutation results are available for adjuvant treatment decisions for patients with stage IIB-IIIA or high risk stage IB-IIA NSCLC. ◊ Diamond 3 modified: Many of the less commonly observed alterations in EGFR, which cumulatively account for ~10% of EGFR-mutation positive NSCLC (ie, exon 19 insertions, p.L861Q, p.G719X, p.S768I) are also associated with responsiveness to certain EGFR TKIs therapy, such as osimertinib and afatinib, and should be considered on a mutation-specific basis, when possible although the number of studied patients is lower.

Updates in Version 1.2022 of the NCCN Guidelines for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer from Version 7.2021 include: NSCL-H 3 of 7 • Bullet 1: Molecular Targets for Analysis Sub-bullet 2: EGFR Gene Mutations
◊ Diamond 4; entry modified: If EGFR p.T790M is observed identified in the absence of prior EGFR TKI therapy, genetic counseling and possible germline genetic testing are warranted. Identification of germline EGFR p.T790M confers a high risk for lung cancer regardless of smoking status.
◊ Diamond 5 modified: EGFR exon 20 (EGFRex20) mutations (other than EGFR p.T790M) are a heterogeneous group, some of which are responsive to targeted therapy and that require detailed knowledge of the specific alteration. – Sub-bullet 1 modified: These are generally associated with lack of response to first-, second-, and third-generation EGFR TKI therapy, with select exceptions: p.A763_Y764insFQEA is associated with sensitivity to TKI therapy and p.A763_Y764insLQEA may be associated with sensitivity to first- and third-generation TKI therapy. – Sub-bullet 2 added: EGFRex20 insertions/duplications are associated with responsiveness to specific targeted subsequent therapy agents. The most commonly represented EGFRex20 insertions/duplications in the clinical studies have been insASV, insSVD, and insNPH, although a wide spectrum of other alterations were included. There is currently no evidence that the specific alteration type impacts the probability of responsiveness to this class of kinase inhibitor. – Sub-bullet 3 modified: Because some EGFRex20 mutations are or may be sensitive to first- and third-generation inhibitors, For this reason, the specific sequence of EGFRex20 insertion mutations isremains important., and Some assays will identify the presence of an EGFRex20 insertion without specifying the sequence. In this scenario, and additional testing to further clarify the EGFRex20 insertion ismay be indicated for therapy selection. – Sub-bullet 4 added: Targeted PCR-based approaches for detection of EGFR variants may under-detect EGFRex20 insertion events; therefore, NGS-based strategies are preferred.
◊ Diamond removed, as content added to NSCL-H 2 of 7: As use of NGS testing increases, additional EGFR variants are increasingly identified; however, the clinical implications of individual alterations are unlikely to be well established.
NSCL-H 5 of 7 • Bullet 1: Molecular Targets for Analysis Sub-bullet 1: KRAS point mutations
◊ Diamond 5 added: The presence of KRAS p.G12C is associated with responsiveness to an oral KRAS G12C inhibitor used for subsequent therapy, which was designed specifically for this mutation. Responsiveness to this class of inhibitor has not been prospectively evaluated with mutations other than KRAS p.G12C.
◊ Diamond 6 added: Testing methodologies: NGS, real-time PCR, and Sanger sequencing (ideally paired with tumor enrichment) are the most commonly deployed methodologies for examining KRAS mutation status.
Sub-bullet 2: MET exon 14 skipping variants ◊ Diamond 3 modified: Testing Methodologies: NGS-based testing is the primary method for detection of METex14 skipping events; RNAbased NGS may have improved demonstrating improvement in detection.

Updates in Version 1.2022 of the NCCN Guidelines for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer from Version 7.2021 include:

NSCL-H 6 of 7

• Bullet 1: Molecular Targets for Analysis

Sub-bullet 1: NTRK1/2/3 gene fusions

◊ Diamond 1 added: The presence of NTRK1/2/3 gene fusions is associated with responsiveness to oral TRK inhibitors.

• Bullet 3: Testing in the Setting of Progression on Targeted Therapy

Diamond 3 added: Broad genomic profiling may be the most informative approach to examining potential mechanisms of resistance, which

may require more than one instance of such profiling over the course of an individual patient’s therapy.

• Bullet 4 added: Testing in the setting of a limited number of pulmonary nodules can aid in distinguishing separate primary lung carcinoma

versus intrapulmonary metastatic disease.

Sub-bullet 1 added: Studies to explore tumor relatedness by testing tissue from separately sampled lesions using a broad gene coverage

NGS approach suggest it may be superior to histopathologic assessment.

Sub-bullet 2 added: Tumor pairs exhibiting entirely non-overlapping, unique mutations are considered clonally unrelated separate primary

lung cancers, even if histologically similar. Tumors that share multiple (≥2) mutations are more likely to be clonally related; however, this

may depend on the extent to which any individual mutation is extremely common in NSCLC and whether identified alterations are driver or

passenger alterations. Results in which no mutations or only one mutation are identified are not informative for this evaluation.

NSCL-H 7 of 7

• PD-L1

Diamond one modified: Various antibody clones have been developed for IHC analysis of PD-L1 expression, and while several show

relative equivalence, are comparable regarding intensity and proportion of cells stained, some doare not.

Diamond one; entry removed: The FDA-approved companion diagnostic for PD-L1 guides utilization of pembrolizumab in patients with

NSCLC and is based on the tumor proportion score (TPS). TPS is the percentage of viable tumor cells showing partial or complete

membrane staining at any intensity.

Diamond one; entry one modified: The definition of positive and negative testing is dependent on the individual antibody, clone, and

platform deployed, which may be unique to each checkpoint inhibitor therapy. The potential for approval of multiple different assays for PD-

L1 has raised concern among both pathologists and oncologists.

Diamond one; entry two added: While some clones for PD-L1 IHC are FDA-approved for specific indications, use of multiple IHC tests is not

necessary, provided any individual IHC test has been internally validated for comparability for categorical results against the FDA-approved

clone.

• Plasma Cell-Free/Circulating Tumor DNA Testing

Sub-bullet 3 modified: Studies have demonstrated cell-free tumor DNA testing to generally have very high specificity, but significantly

compromised sensitivity, with up to a 30% false-negative rate; however, data support complementary testing to reduce turnaround time and

increase yield of targetable alteration detection.

Sub-bullet 4 modified: Published guidelines elaborating standards for analytical performance characteristics of cell-free tumor DNA have

not been established, and in contrast to tissue-based testing, no guidelines exist regarding the recommended performance characteristics

of this type of testing.

Sub-bullet 6; Diamond 3 added: In the initial diagnostic setting, if tissue-based testing does not completely assess all recommended

biomarkers owing to tissue quantity or testing methodologies available, consider repeat biopsy and/or cell-free/circulating tumor DNA

testing.

LUNG CANCER PREVENTION AND SCREENING • Lung cancer is a unique disease in that the major etiologic agent is an addictive product that is made and promoted by an industry.
Approximately 85% to 90% of cases are caused by voluntary or involuntary (second-hand) cigarette smoking. Reduction of lung cancer mortality will require effective public health policies to prevent initiation of smoking, U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) oversight of tobacco products, and other tobacco control measures. • Persistent smoking is associated with second primary cancers, treatment complications, drug interactions, other tobacco-related medical conditions, diminished quality of life, and reduced survival. • Reports from the Surgeon General on both active smoking (http://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/sgr/2004/pdfs/executivesummary.pdf) and second-hand smoke show that both cause lung cancer. The evidence shows a 20% to 30% increase in the risk for lung cancer from second-hand smoke exposure associated with living with a smoker (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK44324/). Every person should be informed of the health consequences, addictive nature, and mortal threat posed by tobacco consumption and exposure to tobacco smoke, and effective legislative, executive, administrative, or other measures should be contemplated at the appropriate governmental level to protect all persons from exposure to tobacco smoke. • Further complicating this problem, the delivery system of lung carcinogens also contains the highly addictive substance, nicotine. Reduction of lung cancer mortality will require widespread implementation of Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Guidelines (http://www.ahrq.gov/professionals/clinicians-providers/guidelines-recommendations/tobacco/index.html) to identify, counsel, and treat patients with nicotine habituation. • Patients who are current or former smokers have significant risk for the development of lung cancer; chemoprevention agents are not yet established for these patients. When possible, these patients should be encouraged to enroll in chemoprevention trials. • Lung cancer screening using low-dose CT (LDCT) is recommended in select high-risk smokers and former smokers (see the NCCN Guidelines for Lung Cancer Screening). • See the NCCN Guidelines for Smoking Cessation.

Note: All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated. Clinical Trials: NCCN believes that the best management of any patient with cancer is in a clinical trial. Participation in clinical trials is especially encouraged.

PRINCIPLES OF DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION
• Patients with a strong clinical suspicion of stage I or II lung cancer (based on risk factors and radiologic appearance) do not require a biopsy before surgery. A biopsy adds time, costs, and procedural risk and may not be needed for treatment decisions. A preoperative biopsy may be appropriate if a non-lung cancer diagnosis is strongly suspected that can be diagnosed by core biopsy or fine-needle aspiration (FNA). A preoperative biopsy may be appropriate if an intraoperative diagnosis appears difficult or very risky.1 If a preoperative tissue diagnosis has not been obtained, then an intraoperative diagnosis (ie, wedge resection, needle biopsy) is necessary before lobectomy, bilobectomy, or pneumonectomy.1
• Bronchoscopy should preferably be performed during the planned surgical resection, rather than as a separate procedure. Bronchoscopy is required before surgical resection (NSCL-2). A separate bronchoscopy may not be needed for treatment decisions before the time of surgery and adds time, costs, and procedural risk. A preoperative bronchoscopy may be appropriate if a central tumor requires pre-resection evaluation for biopsy, surgical planning (eg,
potential sleeve resection), or preoperative airway preparation (eg, coring out an obstructive lesion). • Invasive mediastinal staging is recommended before surgical resection for most patients with clinical stage I or II lung cancer (NSCL-2). Patients should preferably undergo invasive mediastinal staging (mediastinoscopy) as the initial step before the planned resection
(during the same anesthetic procedure), rather than as a separate procedure. For patients undergoing endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)/ endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) staging, this may require a separate procedure to allow evaluation if onsite rapid cytology interpretation is not available. A separate staging procedure adds time, costs, coordination of care, inconvenience, and an additional anesthetic risk. Preoperative invasive mediastinal staging may be appropriate for a strong clinical suspicion of N2 or N3 nodal disease or when intraoperative cytology or frozen section analysis is not available.

1 Patients require tissue confirmation of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) before a lobectomy, bilobectomy, or pneumonectomy. If a preoperative or intraoperative tissue diagnosis appears risky or unreliable, multidisciplinary evaluation that at least includes interventional radiology, thoracic surgery, and interventional pulmonology is recommended to determine the safest and most efficient approach for biopsy, or to provide consensus that a biopsy is too risky or difficult and that the patient can proceed with anatomic resection without tissue confirmation.

Note: All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated. Clinical Trials: NCCN believes that the best management of any patient with cancer is in a clinical trial. Participation in clinical trials is especially encouraged.

◊ Sputum cytology ◊ Bronchoscopy with biopsy and transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA) ◊ Image-guided transthoracic needle core biopsy (preferred) or FNA ◊ Thoracentesis ◊ Mediastinoscopy ◊ Video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) and open surgical biopsy Diagnostic tools that provide important additional strategies for biopsy include: ◊ EBUS–guided biopsy ◊ EUS–guided biopsy ◊ Navigational bronchoscopy ◊ Robotic bronchoscopy • The preferred diagnostic strategy for an individual patient depends on the size and location of the tumor, the presence of mediastinal or distant disease, patient characteristics (such as pulmonary pathology and/or other significant comorbidities), and local experience and expertise. Factors to be considered in choosing the optimal diagnostic step include: ◊ Anticipated diagnostic yield (sensitivity) ◊ Diagnostic accuracy including specificity and particularly the reliability of a negative diagnostic study (ie, true negative) ◊ Adequate volume of tissue specimen for diagnosis and molecular testing ◊ Invasiveness and risk of procedure ◊ Efficiency of evaluation
– Access and timeliness of procedure – Concomitant staging is beneficial, because it avoids additional biopsies or procedures. It is preferable to biopsy the pathology that
would confer the highest stage (ie, to biopsy a suspected metastasis or mediastinal lymph node rather than the pulmonary lesion). Therefore, PET/CT imaging is frequently best performed before a diagnostic biopsy site is chosen in cases of high clinical suspicion for aggressive, advanced-stage tumors. ◊ Technologies and expertise available ◊ Tumor viability at proposed biopsy site from PET/CT imaging Decisions about the optimal diagnostic steps for suspected stage I to III lung cancer should be made by thoracic radiologists, interventional radiologists, and thoracic surgeons who devote a significant portion of their practice to thoracic oncology. Multidisciplinary evaluation should also include a pulmonologist or thoracic surgeon with expertise in advanced bronchoscopic techniques for diagnosis.

Note: All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated. Clinical Trials: NCCN believes that the best management of any patient with cancer is in a clinical trial. Participation in clinical trials is especially encouraged.

PRINCIPLES OF DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION
The least invasive biopsy with the highest yield is preferred as the first diagnostic study. ◊ Patients with central masses and suspected endobronchial involvement should undergo bronchoscopy. ◊ Patients with peripheral (outer one-third) nodules may benefit from navigational bronchoscopy, radial EBUS, or transthoracic needle aspiration (TTNA). ◊ Patients with suspected nodal disease should be biopsied by EBUS, EUS, navigational bronchoscopy, or mediastinoscopy. – EBUS provides access to nodal stations 2R/2L, 4R/4L, 7, 10R/10L, and other hilar nodal stations if necessary. – An EBUS-TBNA negative for malignancy in a clinically (PET and/or CT) positive mediastinum should undergo subsequent mediastinoscopy prior to surgical resection. – EUS–guided biopsy provides additional access to stations 5, 7, 8, and 9 lymph nodes if these are clinically suspicious. – TTNA and anterior mediastinotomy (ie, Chamberlain procedure) provide additional access to anterior mediastinal (stations 5 and 6) lymph nodes if these are clinically suspicious. If TTNA is not possible due to proximity to aorta, VATS biopsy is also an option. ◊ EUS also provides reliable access to the left adrenal gland. ◊ Rapid on-site evaluation (ROSE), when available, helps to increase diagnostic and molecular yield. ◊ Lung cancer patients with an associated pleural effusion should undergo thoracentesis and cytology. A negative cytology result on initial thoracentesis does not exclude pleural involvement. An additional thoracentesis and/or thoracoscopic evaluation of the pleura should be considered before starting curative intent therapy. ◊ Patients suspected of having a solitary site of metastatic disease should have tissue confirmation of that site if feasible. ◊ Patients suspected of having metastatic disease should have confirmation from one of the metastatic sites if feasible. ◊ Patients who may have multiple sites of metastatic disease—based on a strong clinical suspicion—should have biopsy of the primary lung lesion or mediastinal lymph nodes if it is technically difficult or very risky to biopsy a metastatic site.

Note: All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated. Clinical Trials: NCCN believes that the best management of any patient with cancer is in a clinical trial. Participation in clinical trials is especially encouraged.

j PET/CT performed skull base to knees or whole body. Positive PET/CT scan findings for distant disease need pathologic or other radiologic confirmation. If PET/CT scan is positive in the mediastinum, lymph node status needs pathologic confirmation.

t Concurrent Chemoradiation Regimens (NSCL-F). v R0 = no residual tumor, R1 = microscopic residual tumor, R2 = macroscopic
residual tumor. bb Lesions with different cell types (eg, squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma)
are usually different primary tumors. This analysis may be limited by small biopsy samples. However, lesions of the same cell type are not necessarily metastases. Single contralateral lung nodules with clinical, radiologic, or pathologic features suggestive of a synchronous primary lung cancer (eg, long disease-free survival, ground glass components, different histologic characteristics) that are amenable to local therapy should be considered as probable separate primary cancers and eligible for local therapy (NSCL-11). Multiple studies suggest that next-generation sequencing (NGS) testing with broad gene coverage may allow for unambiguous determination of clonal relatedness among separate lung nodules. cc For guidance regarding the evaluation, workup, and management of subsolid pulmonary nodules, please see the diagnostic evaluation of a nodule suspicious for lung cancer (DIAG-1).

becomes high risk for producing symptoms (eg, subsolid nodules with accelerating growth or increasing solid component or increasing FDG uptake, even while small), treatment should be considered. ee Lung-sparing resection is preferred, but tumor distribution and institutional expertise should guide individual treatment planning. Patients should be evaluated in a multidisciplinary setting (ie, surgery, radiation oncology, medical oncology, interventional oncology).

o If MRI is not possible, CT of head with contrast. jj Timing of CT scans within Guidelines parameters is a clinical decision. kk FDG PET/CT is currently not warranted in the routine surveillance and follow-up of patients with NSCLC. However, many benign conditions (such as atelectasis,
consolidation, and radiation fibrosis) are difficult to differentiate from neoplasm on standard CT imaging, and FDG PET/CT can be used to differentiate true malignancy in these settings. However, if FDG PET/CT is to be used as a problem-solving tool in patients after radiation therapy, histopathologic confirmation of recurrent disease is needed because areas previously treated with radiation therapy can remain FDG avid for up to 2 years.

nn The NCCN NSCLC Guidelines Panel strongly advises broader molecular profiling with the goal of identifying rare driver mutations for which effective drugs may already be available, or to appropriately counsel patients regarding the availability of clinical trials. Broad molecular profiling is defined as molecular testing that identifies all biomarkers identified in NSCL-19 in either a single assay or a combination of a limited number of assays, and optimally also identifies emerging biomarkers (NSCL-I). Tiered approaches based on low prevalence of co-occurring biomarkers are acceptable. Broad molecular profiling is a key component of the improvement of care of patients with NSCLC.

PRINCIPLES OF PATHOLOGIC REVIEW • Pathologic Evaluation The purpose of the pathologic evaluation of NSCLC will vary depending on whether the sample 1) is a biopsy or cytology specimen
intended for initial diagnosis in a case of suspected NSCLC; 2) is a resection specimen; or 3) is obtained for molecular evaluation in the setting of an established NSCLC diagnosis. ◊ In small biopsies or cytology specimens intended for initial diagnosis, the primary purpose is a) to make an accurate diagnosis using the
2015 WHO classification; and b) to preserve the tissue for molecular studies, especially if the patient has advanced-stage disease. ◊ In small biopsies of poorly differentiated carcinomas, the terms "non-small cell carcinoma (NSCC)1" or "non-small cell carcinoma not
otherwise specified (NSCC-NOS)" should be used as little as possible and only when a more specific diagnosis is not possible by morphology and/or special staining. ◊ The following terms are acceptable: "NSCC favor adenocarcinoma" and "NSCC favor squamous cell carcinoma." "NSCC-NOS" should be reserved only for cases in which immunohistochemical testing is uninformative or ambiguous (see section on Immunohistochemistry). ◊ Preservation of material for molecular testing is critical. Efforts should be undertaken to minimize block reorientation and the number of (IHC) stains for cases that cannot be classified on histologic examination alone (see section on Immunohistochemistry). In resection specimens, the primary purpose is a) to classify the histologic type; and b) to determine all staging parameters, as recommended by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC), including tumor size, extent of invasion, adequacy of surgical margins, and presence or absence of lymph node metastases. ◊ The number of involved lymph node stations should be documented since it has prognostic significance (AJCC 8th ed). Direct extension of the primary tumor into an adjacent lymph node is considered as nodal involvement. ◊ All lobectomy specimens should be extensively dissected to search for involved lymph nodes. In small biopsies or cytology specimens—obtained for molecular testing in the context of an established diagnosis after progression on targeted therapies, the primary purpose is a) to confirm the original pathologic type with minimal use of tissue for IHC only in suspected small cell carcinoma transformation or a different histology; and b) to preserve material for molecular analysis. • Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) material is suitable for most molecular analyses, except bone biopsies that were previously treated with acid decalcifying solutions. Non-acid decalcification approaches may be successful for subsequent molecular testing. While many molecular pathology laboratories currently also accept cytopathology specimens such as cell blocks, direct smears, or touch preparations, laboratories that do not currently do so are strongly encouraged to identify approaches to testing on non-FFPE cytopathology specimens.

1 Non-small cell carcinomas (NSCC, without the L for lung) that show no clear adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma morphology or immunohistochemical

markers are regarded as NSCC-NOS. In this setting, it is recommended that pathologists use the term NSCC rather than NSCLC, because the lack of pneumocyte

marker expression in small biopsies or cytology leaves open the possibility of a metastatic carcinoma and the determination of a lung primary must be established

clinically after excluding other primary sites.

PRINCIPLES OF PATHOLOGIC REVIEW
NSCLC Classification • The types of NSCLC are: adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, adenosquamous carcinoma, large cell carcinoma, and sarcomatoid
carcinoma. Squamous cell carcinoma: A malignant epithelial tumor that either shows keratinization and/or intercellular bridges, or a morphologically
undifferentiated NSCC that expresses immunohistochemical markers of squamous cell differentiation. Adenocarcinoma:
◊ For small (<3 cm), resected lesions, determining extent of invasion is critical. – Adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS; formerly BAC): A small (≤3 cm) localized nodule with lepidic growth, mostly non-mucinous, although mucinous types can occur. Multiple synchronous AIS tumors can also occur. – Minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA): A small (≤3 cm) solitary adenocarcinoma with a predominantly lepidic pattern and ≤5 mm invasion in greatest dimension. MIA is usually non-mucinous, but rarely may be mucinous. MIA is, by definition, solitary and discrete. – Invasive adenocarcinoma: A malignant epithelial tumor with glandular differentiation, mucin production, or pneumocyte marker expression. The tumors show an acinar, papillary, micropapillary, lepidic, or solid growth pattern, with either mucin or pneumocyte marker expression. The invasive adenocarcinoma component should be present in at least one focus measuring >5 mm in greatest dimension. – Invasive adenocarcinoma variants: invasive mucinous adenocarcinoma, colloid adenocarcinoma, fetal adenocarcinoma, and enteric adenocarcinoma. – Refer to College of American Pathologists Protocols for additional information.
Adenosquamous carcinoma: A carcinoma showing components of both squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma, with each component constituting at least 10% of the tumor. Definitive diagnosis requires a resection specimen, although it may be suggested based on findings in small biopsies, cytology, or excisional biopsies. Presence of any adenocarcinoma component in a biopsy specimen that is otherwise squamous should trigger molecular testing.
Large cell carcinoma: Undifferentiated NSCC that lacks the cytologic, architectural, and histochemical features of small cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, or squamous cell carcinoma. The diagnosis requires a thoroughly sampled resected tumor and cannot be made on nonresection or cytology specimens.
Sarcomatoid carcinoma is a general term that includes pleomorphic carcinoma, carcinosarcoma, and pulmonary blastoma. For this reason, it is best to use the specific term for these entities whenever possible rather than the general term. ◊ Pleomorphic carcinoma is a poorly differentiated NSCC that contains at least 10% spindle and/or giant cells or a carcinoma consisting only of spindle and giant cells. Spindle cell carcinoma consists of an almost pure population of epithelial spindle cells, while Giant cell carcinoma consists almost entirely of tumor giant cells. ◊ Carcinosarcoma is a malignant tumor that consists of a mixture of NSCC and sarcoma-containing heterologous elements (eg, rhabdomyosarcoma, chondrosarcoma, osteosarcoma). ◊ Pulmonary blastoma is a biphasic tumor that consists of fetal adenocarcinoma (typically low grade) and primitive mesenchymal stroma.

NCCN Guidelines Index Table of Contents Discussion

PRINCIPLES OF PATHOLOGIC REVIEW Immunohistochemistry • Judicious use of IHC is strongly recommended to preserve tissue for molecular testing, most notably in small specimens. When
adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinomas are poorly differentiated, the defining morphologic criteria that would allow for specific diagnosis may be inconspicuous or absent. In this case, IHC or mucin staining may be necessary to determine a specific diagnosis. • In small specimens, a limited number of immunostains with one lung adenocarcinoma marker (TTF1, napsin A) and one squamous carcinoma marker (p40, p63) should suffice for most diagnostic problems. Virtually all tumors that lack squamous cell morphology and show co-expression of p63 and TTF1 are preferably classified as adenocarcinoma. A simple panel of TTF1 and p40 may be sufficient to classify most NSCC-NOS cases. • Testing for NUT expression by IHC should be considered in all poorly differentiated carcinomas that lack glandular differentiation or specific etiology, particularly in non-smokers or in patients presenting at a young age, for consideration of a pulmonary NUT carcinoma. • IHC should be used to differentiate primary lung adenocarcinoma from squamous cell carcinoma, large cell carcinoma, metastatic carcinoma, and primary pleural mesothelioma (particularly for pleural specimens). • Primary pulmonary adenocarcinoma: In patients for whom the primary origin of the carcinoma is uncertain, an appropriate panel of immunohistochemical stains is
recommended to assess for metastatic carcinoma to the lung. TTF1 is a homeodomain-containing nuclear transcription protein of the NKX2 gene family that is expressed in epithelial cells of the
embryonal and mature lung and thyroid. TTF1 immunoreactivity is seen in primary pulmonary adenocarcinoma in the majority (70%–90%) of non-mucinous adenocarcinoma subtypes. Metastatic adenocarcinoma to the lung is nearly always negative for TTF1 except in metastatic thyroid malignancies, in which case thyroglobulin and PAX8 are also positive. Rare cases of TTF1 positivity in tumors of other organs (gynecologic tract, pancreatobiliary) have been noted, and may be dependent on the specific TTF1 clone utilized, stressing the importance of correlation with clinical and radiologic features. Napsin A—an aspartic proteinase expressed in normal type II pneumocytes and in proximal and distal renal tubules—appears to be expressed in >80% of lung adenocarcinomas and may be a useful adjunct to TTF1. The panel of TTF1 (or alternatively napsin A) and p40 (or alternatively p63) may be useful in refining the diagnosis to either adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma in small biopsy specimens previously classified as NSCC NOS.

Note: All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated. Clinical Trials: NCCN believes that the best management of any patient with cancer is in a clinical trial. Participation in clinical trials is especially encouraged.

PRINCIPLES OF PATHOLOGIC REVIEW Immunohistochemistry • IHC should be used to confirm neuroendocrine differentiation when there is morphologic evidence of neuroendocrine morphology (eg,
speckled chromatin pattern, nuclear molding, peripheral palisading): NCAM (CD56), chromogranin, synaptophysin, and INSM1 are used to identify neuroendocrine tumors in cases in which morphologic
suspicion of neuroendocrine differentiation exists. A panel of markers is useful, but one positive marker is enough if the staining is unambiguous in more than 10% of the tumor cells. • Malignant mesothelioma versus pulmonary adenocarcinoma The distinction between pulmonary adenocarcinoma and malignant mesothelioma (epithelioid type) can be made by correlation of the
histology with the clinical impression, imaging studies, and a panel of immunomarkers. Immunostains sensitive and specific for mesothelioma include WT-1, calretinin, CK5/6, and D2-40 (usually negative in adenocarcinoma). Immunostains sensitive and specific for adenocarcinoma include pCEA, Claudin 4, TTF1, and napsin A (negative in mesothelioma). Other
potentially useful markers that can be considered include B72.3, Ber-EP4, MOC31, and CD15, but these generally do not have the sensitivity and specificity of the above markers. A pancytokeratin such as AE1/AE3 is also useful, as a negative result suggests the possibility of other tumors. Other markers can be helpful in the differential diagnosis between mesothelioma and metastatic carcinoma, and will also help determine the tumor origin. Examples include markers for lung adenocarcinoma (TTF1 and napsin A), breast carcinoma (ERα, PR, GCDFP15, mammaglobin, and GATA-3), renal cell carcinoma (PAX8), papillary serous carcinoma (PAX8, PAX2, and ER), adenocarcinomas of the gastrointestinal tract (CDX2), and prostate cancer (NKX3.1). Additionally, p40 (or p63) is helpful for distinguishing epithelioid mesotheliomas with pseudosquamous morphology from squamous cell carcinomas.

Evaluation

PRINCIPLES OF SURGICAL THERAPY

• Determination of resectability, surgical staging, and pulmonary resection should be performed by thoracic surgeons who perform lung

cancer surgery as a prominent part of their practice.

• CT and PET/CT used for staging should be within 60 days before proceeding with surgical evaluation.

• For medically operable disease, resection is the preferred local treatment modality (other modalities include SABR, thermal ablation such

as radiofrequency ablation, and cryotherapy). Thoracic surgical oncology consultation should be part of the evaluation of any patient being

considered for curative local therapy. In cases where SABR is considered for high-risk or borderline operable patients, a multidisciplinary

evaluation including a radiation oncologist is recommended.

• The overall plan of treatment as well as needed imaging studies should be determined before any non-emergency treatment is initiated.

• Thoracic surgeons should actively participate in multidisciplinary discussions and meetings regarding lung cancer patients (eg,

multidisciplinary clinic and/or tumor board).

• Patients who are active smokers should be provided counseling and smoking cessation support (NCCN Guidelines for Smoking Cessation).

While active smokers have a mildly increased incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications, these should not be considered

a prohibitive risk for surgery. Surgeons should not deny surgery to patients solely due to smoking status, as surgery provides the

predominant therapy for patients with early-stage lung cancer.

Resection

• Anatomic pulmonary resection is preferred for the majority of patients with NSCLC.

• Sublobar resection - Segmentectomy and wedge resection should achieve parenchymal resection margins ≥2 cm or ≥ the size of the nodule.

• Sublobar resection should also sample appropriate N1 and N2 lymph node stations unless not technically feasible without substantially

increasing the surgical risk.

• Segmentectomy (preferred) or wedge resection is appropriate in selected patients for the following reasons:

Poor pulmonary reserve or other major comorbidity that contraindicates lobectomy Peripheral nodulea ≤2 cm with at least one of the following:

◊ Pure AIS histology

◊ Nodule has ≥50% ground-glass appearance on CT

◊ Radiologic surveillance confirms a long doubling time (≥400 days)

• VATS or minimally invasive surgery (including robotic-assisted approaches) should be strongly considered for patients with no anatomic or

surgical contraindications, as long as there is no compromise of standard oncologic and dissection principles of thoracic surgery.

• In high-volume centers with significant VATS experience, VATS lobectomy in selected patients results in improved early outcomes (ie,

decreased pain, reduced hospital length of stay, more rapid return to function, fewer complications) without compromise of cancer

outcomes.

• Lung-sparing anatomic resection (sleeve lobectomy) is preferred over pneumonectomy, if anatomically appropriate and margin-negative

resection is achieved.

• T3 (invasion) and T4 local extension tumors require en-bloc resection of the involved structure with negative margins. If a surgeon or center

is uncertain about potential complete resection, consider obtaining an additional surgical opinion from a high-volume specialized center.

truly represent areas of risk for local recurrence (eg, medial surface of mainstem or bronchus intermedius when separate subcarinal lymph node dissection has been performed; pleural margin adjacent to aorta when no attachment to aorta is present). • N1 and N2 node resection and mapping should be a routine component of lung cancer resections—a minimum of three N2 stations sampled or complete lymph node dissection. • Formal ipsilateral mediastinal lymph node dissection is indicated for patients undergoing resection for stage IIIA (N2) disease. • Complete resection requires free resection margins, systematic node dissection or sampling, and the highest mediastinal node negative for tumor. The resection is defined as incomplete whenever there is involvement of resection margins, unremoved positive lymph nodes, or positive pleural or pericardial effusions. A complete resection is referred to as R0, microscopically positive resection as R1, and macroscopic residual tumor as R2. • Patients with pathologic stage II or greater, or high-risk factors, should be referred to medical oncology for evaluation. • Consider referral to a radiation oncologist for resected stage IIIA.

The Role of Surgery in Patients with Stage IIIA (N2) NSCLC The role of surgery in patients with pathologically documented N2 disease remains controversial.1 Two randomized trials evaluated the role of surgery in this population, but neither showed an overall survival benefit with the use of surgery.2,3 However, this population is heterogeneous and the panel believes that these trials did not sufficiently evaluate the nuances present with the heterogeneity of N2 disease and the likely oncologic benefit of surgery in specific clinical situations. • The presence or absence of N2 disease should be vigorously determined by both radiologic and invasive staging prior to the initiation of
therapy since the presence of mediastinal nodal disease has a profound impact on prognosis and treatment decisions. (NSCL-1, NSCL-2, and NSCL-6) • Patients with occult-positive N2 nodes discovered at the time of pulmonary resection should continue with the planned resection along with formal mediastinal lymph node dissection. If N2 disease is noted in patients undergoing VATS, the surgeon may consider stopping the procedure so that induction therapy can be administered before surgery; however, continuing the procedure is also an option. • The determination of the role of surgery in a patient with N2-positive lymph nodes should be made prior to the initiation of any therapy by a multidisciplinary team, including a thoracic surgeon who has a major part of his/her practice dedicated to thoracic oncology.4 • The presence of N2-positive lymph nodes substantially increases the likelihood of positive N3 lymph nodes. Pathologic evaluation of the mediastinum must include evaluation of the subcarinal station and contralateral lymph nodes. EBUS +/- EUS are additional techniques for minimally invasive pathologic mediastinal staging that are complementary to mediastinoscopy. Even when these modalities are employed it is important to have an adequate evaluation of the number of stations involved and biopsy and documentation of negative contralateral lymph node involvement prior to a final treatment decision.

• Restaging after induction therapy is difficult to interpret, but CT ± PET should be performed to exclude disease progression or interval development

of metastatic disease. • Patients with negative mediastinum after neoadjuvant therapy have a better prognosis.7,8

• Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy is used in one-third of the NCCN Member Institutions, while neoadjuvant chemotherapy is used in the other twothirds. Overall survival appears similar provided RT is given postoperatively, if not given preoperatively.5,9 Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy is associated with higher rates of pathologic complete response and negative mediastinal lymph nodes.10 However, that is achieved at the expense of

higher rates of acute toxicity and increased cost.

• When neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy is used with doses lower than those used for standard definitive therapy, all efforts should be made to

minimize any possible breaks in radiotherapy for surgical evaluation. Treatment breaks of more than 1 week are considered unacceptable.

• When timely surgical evaluation is not available, the strategy of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy should not be used. Another option in individual

cases, and with the agreement of the thoracic surgeon, is to complete definitive chemoradiotherapy prior to re-evaluation and consideration for surgery.11,12 If a surgeon or center is uncertain about the feasibility or safety of resection after definitive doses of radiation, consider obtaining an

additional surgical opinion from a high-volume specialized center. These operations may also benefit from additional considerations of soft tissue

flap coverage in the radiation field at the time of resection.

• Data from a large multi-institutional trial indicate that pneumonectomy after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy has unacceptable morbidity and mortality.2 However, it is not clear if this is also true with neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone. Further, many groups have challenged that cooperative group finding with single-institution experiences demonstrating safety of pneumonectomy after induction therapy.13-16 In addition, there is no

A questionnaire was submitted to the NCCN Member Institutions in 2021 regarding their approach to patients with N2 disease. Their responses indicate the patterns of practice when approaching this difficult clinical problem. • All NCCN institutions treat select N2 patients with multimodality therapy that includes surgery. • The majority of NCCN institutions prefer EBUS for initial mediastinal staging, reserving mediastinoscopy for possible restaging. • The majority of institutions do not pathologically restage mediastinal lymph nodes after induction therapy and prior to surgery. • All NCCN institutions consider surgery for single-station non-bulky N2 disease. • Approximately half of the institutions consider surgery for single-station bulky disease, 39% for multi-station non-bulky disease, and 21% for multi-station
bulky disease. • Two-thirds of institutions prefer induction chemotherapy; one-third prefer chemoradiation. • The majority require at least stable disease after induction, but do not require radiologic or pathologic response prior to surgery. • Roughly a half would consider pneumonectomy after induction chemotherapy, but less than a quarter would consider pneumonectomy after chemoradiation. • Approximately three-fourths would give adjuvant RT for positive residual N2 disease, but only approximately one-fourth would give RT for N2 pathologic
complete response. References

PRINCIPLES OF RADIATION THERAPY
I. General Principles (see Table 1. Commonly Used Abbreviations in Radiation Therapy) • Determination of the appropriateness of radiation therapy (RT) should be made by radiation oncologists who perform lung cancer RT as a
prominent part of their practice. • RT has a potential role in all stages of NSCLC, as either definitive/consolidative or palliative therapy. Radiation oncology input as part of a
multidisciplinary evaluation or discussion should be provided for all patients with stage III NSCLC, with early-stage disease who are medically inoperable, who refuse surgery, or who are high-risk surgical candidates, and with stage IV disease that may benefit from local therapy. • The critical goals of modern RT are to maximize tumor control and to minimize treatment toxicity. A minimum technologic standard is CTplanned 3D-CRT.1 • More advanced technologies are appropriate when needed to deliver curative RT safely. These technologies include (but are not limited to) 4D-CT and/or PET/CT simulation, IMRT/VMAT, IGRT, motion management, and proton therapy (https://www.astro.org/Daily-Practice/ Reimbursement/Model-Policies/Model-Policies/). Nonrandomized comparisons of using advanced technologies demonstrate reduced toxicity and improved survival versus older techniques.2-4 In a prospective trial of definitive/consolidative chemo/RT for patients with stage III NSCLC (RTOG 0617), IMRT was associated with a nearly 60% decrease (from 7.9% to 3.5%) in high-grade radiation pneumonitis as well as similar survival and tumor control outcomes despite a higher proportion of stage IIIB and larger treatment volumes compared to 3D-CRT;5 as such, IMRT is preferred over 3D-CRT in this setting. • Centers using advanced technologies should implement and document modality-specific quality assurance measures. The ideal is external credentialing of both treatment planning and delivery such as required for participation in RTOG clinical trials employing advanced technologies. Useful references include the ACR Practice Parameters and Technical Standards (https://www.acr.org/~/media/ACR/Documents/ PGTS/toc.pdf). • The interaction of strong VEGF inhibitors with prior or subsequent dose-intensive RT (SABR or definitive dose accelerated fractionation) involving the proximal bronchial tree, hilar vessels, or esophagus can lead to serious toxicity. Careful coordination of medical and radiation oncology on the therapeutic strategy is important, including the choice and sequencing of systemic agents with strong VEGF inhibitors and the dose and fractionation of radiation, especially for patients with metastatic disease.

II. Radiation Therapy Simulation, Planning, and Delivery

• Simulation should be performed using CT scans obtained in the RT treatment position with appropriate immobilization devices. IV contrast with

or without oral contrast is recommended for better target/organ delineation whenever possible in patients with central tumors or nodal disease.

Because IV contrast can affect tissue heterogeneity correction calculations, density masking or use of a pre-contrast scan may be needed when

intense enhancement is present. • PET/CT significantly improves targeting accuracy,6 especially for patients with significant atelectasis and when IV CT contrast is

contraindicated. A randomized trial of PET/CT versus CT-only RT planning demonstrated improved preemption of futile radical RT, decreased recurrences, and a trend toward improved overall survival with PET/CT RT planning.7 Given the potential for rapid progression of NSCLC,8,9

PET/CT should be obtained preferably within 4 weeks before treatment. It is ideal to obtain PET/CT in the treatment position.

• Tumor and organ motion, especially owing to breathing, should be assessed or accounted for at simulation. Options include fluoroscopy,

inhale/exhale or slow scan CT, or, ideally, 4D-CT.

PRINCIPLES OF RADIATION THERAPY
II. Radiation Therapy Simulation, Planning, and Delivery (continued) • Photon beam energy should be individualized based on the anatomic location of the tumors and beam paths. In general, photon energies
between 4 to 10 MV are recommended for beams passing through low-density lung tissue before entering the tumor. When there is no air gap before the beam enters the tumor (such as for some large mediastinal tumors or tumors attached to the chest wall), higher energies may improve the dose distribution, especially when using a smaller number of fixed beam angles. • Tissue heterogeneity correction and accurate dose calculation algorithms are recommended that account for buildup and lateral electron scatter effects in heterogeneous density tissues. Heterogeneity correction with simple pencil beam algorithms is not recommended.10 • Respiratory motion should be managed when motion is excessive. This includes (but is not limited to) forced shallow breathing with abdominal compression, accelerator beam gating with the respiratory cycle, dynamic tumor tracking, active breathing control (ABC), or coaching/biofeedback techniques. If motion is minimal or the ITV is small, motion-encompassing targeting is appropriate. A useful resource for implementation of respiratory motion management is the report of AAPM Task Group 76.11 • IGRT—including (but not limited to) orthogonal pair planar imaging and/or volumetric imaging (such as CBCT or CT on rails)—is recommended when using SABR, 3D-CRT/IMRT, and proton therapy with steep dose gradients around the target, when OARs are in close proximity to high-dose regions, and when using complex motion management techniques.
III. Target Volumes, Prescription Doses, and Normal Tissue Dose Constraints (See Tables 2–5 on NSCL-C 7 of 10 and NSCL-C 8 of 10) • ICRU Reports 62 and 83 detail the current definitions of target volumes for 3D-RT and IMRT. GTV comprises the known extent of disease
(primary and nodal) on imaging and pathologic assessment, CTV includes regions of presumed microscopic extent or dissemination, and PTV comprises the ITV (which includes margin for target motion) plus a setup margin for positioning and mechanical variability. https://www.nrgoncology.org/ciro-lung • PTV margin can be decreased by immobilization, motion management, and IGRT techniques. • Consistent delineation of normal structures is critical for evaluating plans for safety. The RTOG consensus lung-contouring atlas is a useful resource. https://www.nrgoncology.org/ciro-lung • Commonly used prescription doses and normal tissue dose constraints are summarized in Tables 2 through 5. These are based on published experience, ongoing trials, historical data, modeling, and empirical judgment.12,13 Useful references include the recent reviews of normal organ dose responses from the QUANTEC project.14-18 Because risk of normal organ toxicity increases with dose, doses to normal organs should be kept as low as reasonably achievable rather than simply meeting nominal constraints. This is generally facilitated by more advanced techniques to achieve better dose conformity.

PRINCIPLES OF RADIATION THERAPY
IV. General Treatment Information Early-Stage NSCLC (Stage I, selected node-negative Stage IIA) • SABR (also known as SBRT)19 has achieved good primary tumor control rates and overall survival, higher than conventionally fractionated
radiotherapy. Although SABR is not proven equivalent to lobectomy, some prospective series have demonstrated similar overall and cancerspecific survival.20-30 • SABR is also an appropriate option for patients with high surgical risk (able to tolerate sublobar resection but not lobectomy [eg, age ≥75 years, poor lung function]). • More modestly hypofractionated or dose-intensified conventionally fractionated 3D-CRT regimens are less preferred alternatives and may be considered if referral for SABR is not feasible.31-33 • In patients treated with surgery, postoperative radiotherapy (PORT) is not recommended unless there are positive margins or upstaging to N2 (see Locally Advanced NSCLC in this section). • Close follow-up and salvage therapy for isolated local and/or locoregional recurrence after SABR have been shown to improve overall survival in a large retrospective study.34
SABR for Node-Negative Early-Stage NSCLC • The high-dose intensity and conformity of SABR require minimizing the PTV. • Dosing regimen For SABR, intensive regimens of BED ≥100 Gy are associated with significantly better local control and survival than less intensive
regimens.35,36 In the United States, only regimens of ≤5 fractions meet the arbitrary billing code definition of SBRT, but slightly more protracted regimens are appropriate as well.35,37 For centrally located tumors (defined variably as within 2 cm of the proximal bronchial tree and/or abutting mediastinal pleura) and even ultra-central tumors (defined as abutting the proximal bronchial tree), 4 to 10 fraction riskadapted SABR regimens appear to be effective and safe,38-41 while 54 to 60 Gy in 3 fractions is unsafe and should be avoided.42 However, particular attention should be paid to tumors abutting the bronchial tree and esophagus to avoid severe toxicity. RTOG 0813 evaluated the toxicity of 5-fraction regimens and found no high-grade toxicities at 50 Gy in 5 fractions.43 • SABR is most commonly used for tumors up to 5 cm in size, though selected larger isolated tumors can be treated safely if normal tissue constraints are respected.43,44 • Prescription doses incompletely describe the actual delivered doses, which also strongly depend on how the dose is prescribed (to the isocenter vs. an isodose volume covering a proportion of the PTV), the degree of dose heterogeneity, whether tissue density heterogeneity corrections are used, and the type of dose calculation algorithm.10,45,46 All of these must be considered when interpreting or emulating regimens from prior studies.

PRINCIPLES OF RADIATION THERAPY
Locally Advanced NSCLC (Stage II–III) • Concurrent chemotherapy/RT is recommended for patients with inoperable stage II (node-positive) and stage III NSCLC.47-50 • RT interruptions and dose reductions for manageable acute toxicities should be avoided by employing supportive care. • Sequential chemotherapy/RT or RT alone is appropriate for frail patients unable to tolerate concurrent therapy.51,52
Accelerated RT regimens may be beneficial, particularly if concurrent chemotherapy would not be tolerated (ie, in a sequential or RT-only approach).53,54 • Preoperative concurrent chemotherapy/RT is an option for patients with resectable stage IIIA (minimal N2 and treatable with lobectomy)55 NSCLC and is recommended for resectable superior sulcus tumors.56,57 RT should be planned up front such that it continues to a definitive dose without interruption if the patient does not proceed to surgery as initially planned. • Preoperative chemotherapy and postoperative RT is an alternative for patients with resectable stage IIIA disease.58,59 The optimal timing of RT in trimodality therapy (preoperative with chemotherapy or postoperative) is not established and is controversial.60,61 • The determination of resectability in trimodality therapy should be made prior to initiation of all treatment. Upfront multidisciplinary consultation is particularly important when considering surgical treatment of patients with stage III NSCLC. • In patients with clinical stage I/II upstaged surgically to N2+, PORT appears to improve survival significantly as an adjunct to postoperative chemotherapy in non-randomized analyses.62,63 Although the optimal sequence is not established, PORT is generally administered after postoperative chemotherapy and concurrently with chemotherapy for positive resection margins.64-67 • PORT is not recommended for patients with pathologic stage N0–1 disease, because it has been associated with increased mortality, at least when using older RT techniques.68
Conventionally Fractionated RT for Locally Advanced NSCLC • IFI omitting ENI allows tumor dose escalation and is associated with a low risk of isolated nodal relapse, particularly in a patient staged with
PET/CT.69-73 Three randomized trials found improved survival for IFI versus ENI, possibly because it enabled dose escalation.74-76 IFI is reasonable in order to optimize definitive dosing to the tumor and/or decrease normal tissue toxicity. 75,76 • Dosing Regimens The most commonly prescribed doses for definitive RT are 60 to 70 Gy in 2 Gy fractions. Doses of at least 60 Gy should be given.77 Dose
escalation is associated with better survival in non-randomized comparisons in RT alone,78 sequential chemo/RT,79 or concurrent chemo/RT.80 While optimal RT dose intensification remains a valid question, a high dose of 74 Gy is not currently recommended for routine use.81-86 A meta-analysis demonstrated improved survival with accelerated fractionation RT regimens,87 and RTOG 1106 found that PET-based individualized accelerated RT dose intensification potentially improved local control but not overall survival.88

PRINCIPLES OF RADIATION THERAPY Conventionally Fractionated RT for Locally Advanced NSCLC (continued) • Dosing Regimens Doses of 45 to 54 Gy in 1.8 to 2 Gy fractions are standard preoperative doses.89 Definitive RT doses delivered as preoperative chemoRT can
safely be administered and achieve promising nodal clearance and survival rates,90-93 but require experience in thoracic surgical techniques to minimize the risk of surgical complications after high-dose RT. In PORT, the CTV includes the bronchial stump and high-risk draining lymph node stations.94 Standard doses after complete resection are 50 to 54 Gy in 1.8 to 2 Gy fractions, but a boost may be administered to high-risk regions including areas of nodal extracapsular extension or microscopic positive margins.62,63,95 Lung dose constraints should be more conservative, because tolerance appears to be reduced after surgery. The ongoing European LungART trial provides useful guidelines for PORT technique.96

Advanced/Metastatic NSCLC (Stage IV) • RT is recommended for local palliation or prevention of symptoms (such as pain, bleeding, or obstruction). • Definitive/consolidative local therapy to isolated or limited metastatic sites (oligometastases) (including but not limited to brain, lung, and adrenal
gland) achieves prolonged survival in a small proportion of well-selected patients with good performance status who have also received radical therapy to the intrathoracic disease.97 Definitive RT to oligometastases (limited number is not universally defined but clinical trials have included 3–5 metastases), particularly SABR, is an appropriate option in such cases if it can be delivered safely to the involved sites.98,99 In two randomized phase II trials, significantly improved progression-free survival and overall survival in one trial100,101 were found for local consolidative therapy (RT or surgery) to oligometastatic lesions versus maintenance systemic therapy or observation for patients not progressing on systemic therapy.100-102 • In the setting of progression at a limited number of sites on a given line of systemic therapy (oligoprogression), local ablative therapy to the oligoprogressive sites may extend the duration of benefit of the current line of systemic therapy. • When treating oligometastatic/oligoprogressive lesions, if SABR is not feasible, other dose-intensive accelerated/hypofractionated CRT regimens may be used. • See the NCCN Guidelines for Central Nervous System Cancers regarding RT for brain metastases. • A pooled analysis of two randomized trials indicated that adding radiotherapy to a certain immune checkpoint inhibitor (anti-PD-1) significantly increased responses and clinical outcomes in patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. Larger phase III randomized studies are ongoing.103

Palliative RT for Advanced/Metastatic NSCLC • The dose and fractionation of palliative RT should be individualized based on goals of care, symptoms, performance status, and logistical
considerations. Shorter courses of RT are preferred for patients with poor performance status and/or shorter life expectancy because they provide similar pain relief as longer courses, although there is a higher potential need for retreatment.104-107 For palliation of thoracic symptoms, higher dose/longer-course thoracic RT (eg, ≥30 Gy in 10 fractions) is associated with modestly improved survival and symptoms, particularly in patients with good performance status.108,109 When higher doses (>30 Gy) are warranted, technologies to reduce normal tissue irradiation (at least 3D-CRT and including IMRT or proton therapy as appropriate) may be used. • Single-fraction stereotactic RT of 12–16 Gy produced better control of pain response and local control of non-spine bone metastases compared to standard 30 Gy in 10 fractions in a randomized phase II trial, and may be promising for patients with longer expected survival.110

†These constraints represent doses that generally should not be exceeded, based on a consensus survey of NCCN Member Institutions. Because the risk of toxicity increases progressively with dose to normal tissues, a key principle of radiation treatment planning is to keep normal tissue doses "as low as reasonably achievable" while adequately covering the target. The doses to any given organ at risk should typically be lower than these constraints, approaching them only when there is close proximity to the target volume.

§ Use V20 <35%, especially for the following: elderly ≥70 years, taxane chemotherapy, and poor PFTs (such as FEV1 or DLCO <50% normal). Use more conservative limits with a diagnosis or radiologic evidence of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IDP)/usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) (the tolerance of these patients is lower though not well characterized).

PRINCIPLES OF IMAGE-GUIDED THERMAL ABLATION THERAPY

General Principles • Interventional radiologists should actively participate in multidisciplinary discussions and meetings regarding patients with NSCLC (eg, multidisciplinary
clinic and/or tumor board). • Decisions about whether ablation is feasible should be performed by interventional radiologists who perform IGTA as a prominent part of their practice. • IGTA includes radiofrequency ablation, microwave ablation, and cryoablation. IGTA is a form of “local therapy” or “local ablative therapy.”1 • IGTA is a lung parenchymal sparing technique with at most a temporary decrement in FEV1 and DLCO, which is statistically indistinguishable from
baseline after recovery.2-6 Evaluation • IGTA may be considered for those patients who are deemed “high risk”—those with tumors that are for the most part surgically resectable but rendered
medically inoperable due to comorbidities. In cases where IGTA is considered for high-risk or borderline operable patients, a multidisciplinary evaluation is recommended. • IGTA has been successfully accomplished in patients considered “high risk,” objectively defined with a single major and/or two or more minor criteria. Major criteria included an FEV1 or DCLO ≤50%, and minor criteria included a less depressed FEV1 or DLCO between 51%–60%, advanced age ≥75 years, pulmonary hypertension, LVEF ≤40%, resting or exercise PaO2 <55 mmHg, and pCO2 >45 mmHg.4 • If an interventional radiologist or center is uncertain about the feasibility or safety of IGTA or the use of IGTA for radiation failure, consider obtaining an additional interventional radiology opinion from a high-volume specialized center. Ablation • Each energy modality has advantages and disadvantages. Determination of energy modality to be used for ablation should take into consideration the size and location of the target tumor, risk of complication, as well as local expertise and/or operator familiarity.7 Ablation for NSCLC • IGTA is an option for the management of NSCLC lesions <3 cm. Ablation for NSCLC lesions >3 cm may be associated with higher rates of local recurrence and complications.8,9 • There is evidence on the use of IGTA for selected patients with Stage 1A NSCLC, those who present with multiple lung cancers, or those who present with locoregional recurrence of symptomatic local thoracic disease. • Like surgery, pneumothorax may occur after IGTA, particularly if multiple lesions are treated in a single session. Pneumothorax has been reported in 18.7%–45.7% of IGTA cases. Self-limited pneumothorax, not requiring chest tube placement, is an expected event and not considered a complication unless escalation of care is required. In 20.7% of IGTA cases, chest tube insertion may be required.10

PRINCIPLES OF MOLECULAR AND BIOMARKER ANALYSIS Molecular Diagnostic Studies in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer • Numerous gene alterations have been identified that impact therapy selection. Testing of lung cancer specimens for these alterations is important
for identification of potentially efficacious targeted therapies, as well as avoidance of therapies unlikely to provide clinical benefit. • Some selection approaches for targeted therapy include predictive immunohistochemical analyses, which are distinct from immunohistochemical
studies utilized to identify tumor type and lineage. • Major elements of molecular testing that are critical for utilization and interpretation of molecular results include: Use of a laboratory that is properly accredited, with a minimum of CLIA accreditation Understanding the methodologies that are utilized and the major limitations of those methodologies Understanding the spectrum of alterations tested (and those not tested) by a specific assay Knowledge of whether a tumor sample is subjected to pathologic review and tumor enrichment (ie, microdissection, macrodissection) prior to
testing The types of samples accepted by the testing laboratory • Tissue Specimen Acquisition and Management: Although tumor testing has been primarily focused on use of FFPE tissues, increasingly, laboratories accept other specimen types, notably
cytopathology preparations not processed by FFPE methods. Although testing on cell blocks is not included in the FDA approval for multiple companion diagnostic assays, testing on these specimen types is highly recommended when it is the only or best material. A major limitation in obtaining tissue molecular testing results for NSCLC occurs when minimally invasive techniques are used to obtain samples; the yield may be insufficient for molecular, biomarker, and histologic testing. Therefore, bronchoscopists and interventional radiologists should procure sufficient tissue to enable all appropriate testing. When tissue is minimal, laboratories should deploy techniques to maximize tissue for molecular and ancillary testing, including dedicated histology protocols for small biopsies, including “up-front” slide sectioning for diagnostic and predictive testing. Peripheral blood (plasma circulating tumor DNA) can be a surrogate sample (NSCL-H 7 of 7).

Note: All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated. Clinical Trials: NCCN believes that the best management of any patient with cancer is in a clinical trial. Participation in clinical trials is especially encouraged.

PRINCIPLES OF MOLECULAR AND BIOMARKER ANALYSIS • Testing Methodologies Appropriate possible testing methodologies are indicated below for each analyte separately; however, several methodologies are generally
considerations for use: ◊ Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is used in clinical laboratories. Not all types of alterations are detected by individual NGS assays and it is
important to be familiar with the types of alterations identifiable in individual assays or combination(s) of assays. ◊ It is recommended at this time that when feasible, testing be performed via a broad, panel-based approach, most typically performed by NGS.
For patients who, in broad panel testing don’t have identifiable driver oncogenes (especially in never smokers), consider RNA-based NGS if not already performed, to maximize detection of fusion events. – Broad molecular profiling is defined as molecular testing that identifies all biomarkers identified in NSCL-19 in either a single assay or a
combination of a limited number of assays, and optimally also identifies emerging biomarkers (NSCL-I). Tiered approaches based on low prevalence of co-occurring biomarkers are acceptable. ◊ Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can be used in a highly targeted fashion (specific mutations targeted). When this technology is deployed, only those specific alterations that are targeted by the assay are assessed. ◊ Sanger sequencing requires the greatest degree of tumor enrichment. Unmodified Sanger sequencing is not appropriate for detection of mutations in tumor samples with less than 25% to 30% tumor after enrichment and is not appropriate for assays in which identification of subclonal events (eg, resistance mutations) is important. If Sanger sequencing is utilized, tumor enrichment methodologies are nearly always recommended. ◊ Any method that interrogates sequences other than a subset of highly specific alterations (eg, NGS, Sanger) has the potential to identify variants of uncertain significance (VUS). Any variant classified as a VUS, even if in a gene in which other variants are clinically actionable, should not be considered as a basis for targeted therapy selection. ◊ Other methodologies may be utilized, including multiplex approaches not listed above. ◊ Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis is utilized for many assays examining copy number, amplification, and structural alterations such as gene rearrangements.

Note: All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated. Clinical Trials: NCCN believes that the best management of any patient with cancer is in a clinical trial. Participation in clinical trials is especially encouraged.

PRINCIPLES OF MOLECULAR AND BIOMARKER ANALYSIS • Molecular Targets for Analysis In general, the mutations/alterations described below are seen in a non-overlapping fashion, although between 1%–3% of NSCLC may harbor
concurrent alterations. EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor) Gene Mutations: EGFR is a receptor tyrosine kinase normally found on the surface of epithelial cells and
is often overexpressed in a variety of human malignancies. ◊ The most commonly described mutations in EGFR (exon 19 deletions, p.L858R point mutation in exon 21) are associated with responsiveness to
oral EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy; most recent data indicate that tumors that do not harbor a sensitizing EGFR mutation should not be treated with EGFR TKI in any line of therapy. ◊ Molecular testing for EGFR mutations should be performed when adjuvant TKI therapy is a consideration for NSCLC stage IB–IIIA. While the testing process may be technically easier on a resection specimen, initial diagnostic biopsy specimens are also acceptable for testing for this indication. ◊ Many of the less commonly observed alterations in EGFR, which cumulatively account for ~10% of EGFR-mutation positive NSCLC (ie, exon 19 insertions, p.L861Q, p.G719X, p.S768I) are also associated with responsiveness to certain EGFR TKIs, such as osimertinib and afatinib, and should be considered on a mutation-specific basis, when possible. ◊ EGFR p.T790M is most commonly observed as a mutation that arises in response to and as a mechanism of resistance to first- and secondgeneration EGFR TKI. In patients with progression on first- or second-generation TKI with p.T790M as the primary mechanism of resistance, thirdgeneration TKIs are typically efficacious. – If EGFR p.T790M is identified in the absence of prior EGFR TKI therapy, genetic counseling and possible germline genetic testing are warranted.
Identification of germline EGFR p.T790M confers a high risk for lung cancer regardless of smoking status. ◊ EGFR exon 20 (EGFRex20) mutations (other than EGFR p.T790M) are a heterogeneous group, some of which are responsive to targeted therapy
and that require detailed knowledge of the specific alteration. – Most EGFRex20 alterations are a diverse group of in-frame duplication or insertion mutations.
▪ These are generally associated with lack of response to first-, second-, and third-generation EGFR TKI therapy, with select exceptions: p.A763_Y764insFQEA is associated with sensitivity to TKI therapy and p.A763_Y764insLQEA may be associated with sensitivity to first- and third-generation TKI therapy.
▪ EGFRex20 insertions/duplications are associated with responsiveness to specific targeted subsequent therapy agents. The most commonly represented EGFRex20 insertions/duplications in the clinical studies have been insASV, insSVD, and insNPH, although a wide spectrum of other alterations were included. There is currently no evidence that the specific alteration type impacts the probability of responsiveness to this class of kinase inhibitor.
▪ Because some EGFRex20 mutations are or may be sensitive to first- and third-generation inhibitors, the specific sequence of EGFRex20 insertion mutations remains important. Some assays will identify the presence of an EGFRex20 insertion without specifying the sequence, and additional testing to further clarify the EGFRex20 insertion may be indicated for therapy selection.
▪ Targeted PCR-based approaches for detection of EGFR variants may under-detect EGFRex20 insertion events; therefore, NGS-based strategies are preferred.
◊ Some clinicopathologic features—such as smoking status, ethnicity, and histology—are associated with the presence of an EGFR mutation; however, these features should not be utilized in selecting patients for testing.
◊ Testing Methodologies: Real-time PCR, Sanger sequencing (ideally paired with tumor enrichment), and NGS are the most commonly deployed methodologies for examining EGFR mutation status.

Note: All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated. Clinical Trials: NCCN believes that the best management of any patient with cancer is in a clinical trial. Participation in clinical trials is especially encouraged.

PRINCIPLES OF MOLECULAR AND BIOMARKER ANALYSIS • Molecular Targets for Analysis (continued) ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase) Gene Rearrangements: ALK is a receptor tyrosine kinase that can be rearranged in NSCLC, resulting in
dysregulation and inappropriate signaling through the ALK kinase domain. ◊ The most common fusion partner seen with ALK is echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (EML4), although a variety of other fusion
partners have been identified. ◊ The presence of an ALK rearrangement is associated with responsiveness to oral ALK TKIs. ◊ Some clinicopathologic features—such as smoking status and histology—have been associated with the presence of an ALK rearrangement;
however, these features should not be utilized in selecting patients for testing. ◊ Testing Methodologies: FISH break-apart probe methodology was the first methodology deployed widely. IHC can be deployed as an effective
screening strategy. FDA-approved IHC can be utilized as a stand-alone test, not requiring confirmation by FISH. Numerous NGS methodologies can detect ALK fusions. Targeted real-time PCR assays are used in some settings, although it is unlikely to detect fusions with novel partners. ROS1 (ROS proto-oncogene 1) Gene Rearrangements: ROS1 is a receptor tyrosine kinase that can be rearranged in NSCLC, resulting in dysregulation and inappropriate signaling through the ROS1 kinase domain. ◊ Numerous fusion partners are seen with ROS1, and common fusion partners include: CD74, SLC34A2, CCDC6, and GOPC (FIG). ◊ The presence of a ROS1 rearrangement is associated with responsiveness to oral ROS1 TKIs. ◊ Some clinicopathologic features—such as smoking status and histology—have been associated with the presence of a ROS1 rearrangement; however, these features should not be utilized in selecting patients for testing. ◊ Testing Methodologies: FISH break-apart probe methodology can be deployed; however, it may under-detect the FIG-ROS1 variant. IHC approaches can be deployed; however, IHC for ROS1 fusions has low specificity, and follow-up confirmatory testing is a necessary component of utilizing ROS1 IHC as a screening modality. Numerous NGS methodologies can detect ROS1 fusions, although DNA-based NGS may underdetect ROS1 fusions. Targeted real-time PCR assays are utilized in some settings, although they are unlikely to detect fusions with novel partners.

PRINCIPLES OF MOLECULAR AND BIOMARKER ANALYSIS
• Molecular Targets for Analysis (continued) BRAF (B-Raf proto-oncogene) point mutations: BRAF is a serine/threonine kinase that is part of the canonical MAP/ERK signaling pathway.
Activating mutations in BRAF result in unregulated signaling through the MAP/ERK pathway. ◊ Mutations in BRAF can be seen in NSCLC. The presence of a specific mutation resulting in a change in amino acid position 600 (p.V600E) has
been associated with responsiveness to combined therapy with oral inhibitors of BRAF and MEK. ◊ Note that other mutations in BRAF are observed in NSCLC, and the impact of those mutations on therapy selection is not well understood at
this time. ◊ Testing Methodologies: Real-time PCR, Sanger sequencing (ideally paired with tumor enrichment), and NGS are the most commonly deployed
methodologies for examining BRAF mutation status. While an anti-BRAF p.V600E-specific monoclonal antibody is commercially available, and some studies have examined utilizing this approach, it should only be deployed after extensive validation. KRAS (KRAS proto-oncogene) point mutations: KRAS is a G-protein with intrinsic GTPase activity, and activating mutations result in unregulated signaling through the MAP/ERK pathway. ◊ Mutations in KRAS are most commonly seen at codon 12, although other mutations can be seen in NSCLC. ◊ The presence of a KRAS mutation is prognostic of poor survival when compared to patients with tumors without KRAS mutation. ◊ Mutations in KRAS have been associated with reduced responsiveness to EGFR TKI therapy. ◊ Owing to the low probability of overlapping targetable alterations, the presence of a known activating mutation in KRAS identifies patients who are unlikely to benefit from further molecular testing. ◊ The presence of KRAS p.G12C is associated with responsiveness to an oral KRAS G12C inhibitor used for subsequent therapy, which was designed specifically for this mutation. Responsiveness to this class of inhibitor has not been prospectively evaluated with mutations other than KRAS p.G12C. ◊ Testing methodologies: NGS, real-time PCR, and Sanger sequencing (ideally paired with tumor enrichment) are the most commonly deployed methodologies for examining KRAS mutation status. MET (mesenchymal-epithelial transition) exon 14 (METex14) skipping variants: MET is a receptor tyrosine kinase. A mutation that results in loss of exon 14 can occur in NSCLC. Loss of METex14 leads to dysregulation and inappropriate signaling. ◊ The presence of METex14 skipping mutation is associated with responsiveness to oral MET TKIs. ◊ A broad range of molecular alterations lead to METex14 skipping. ◊ Testing Methodologies: NGS-based testing is the primary method for detection of METex14 skipping events; RNA-based NGS may have improved detection. IHC is not a method for detection of METex14 skipping. RET (rearranged during transfection) Gene Rearrangements: RET is a receptor tyrosine kinase that can be rearranged in NSCLC, resulting in dysregulation and inappropriate signaling through the RET kinase domain. ◊ Common fusion partners are KIF5B, NCOA4, and CCDC6; however, numerous other fusion partners have been identified. ◊ The presence of a RET rearrangement is associated with responsiveness to oral RET TKIs regardless of fusion partner. ◊ Testing Methodologies: FISH break-apart probe methodology can be deployed; however, it may under-detect some fusions. Targeted real-time reverse-transcriptase PCR assays are utilized in some settings, although they are unlikely to detect fusions with novel partners. NGS-based methodology has a high specificity, and RNA-based NGS is preferable to DNA-based NGS for fusion detection.

PRINCIPLES OF MOLECULAR AND BIOMARKER ANALYSIS • Molecular Targets for Analysis (continued) NTRK1/2/3 (neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase) gene fusions
◊ The presence of NTRK1/2/3 gene fusions is associated with responsiveness to oral TRK inhibitors. ◊ NTRK1/2/3 are tyrosine receptor kinases that are rarely rearranged in NSCLC as well as in other tumor types, resulting in dysregulation and
inappropriate signaling. ◊ Numerous fusion partners have been identified. ◊ To date, no specific clinicopathologic features, other than absence of other driver alterations, have been identified in association with these
fusions. ◊ Point mutations in NTRK1/2/3 are generally non-activating and have not been studied in association with targeted therapy. ◊ Testing Methodologies: Various methodologies can be used to detect NTRK1/2/3 gene fusions, including: FISH, IHC, PCR, and NGS; false
negatives may occur. IHC methods are complicated by baseline expression in some tissues. FISH testing may require at least 3 probe sets for full analysis. NGS testing can detect a broad range of alterations. DNA-based NGS may under-detect NTRK1 and NTRK3 fusions. • In the event that a complete assessment for all biomarkers cannot be reasonably accomplished prior to initiation of therapy, consider repeat panel testing or selected biomarker testing at progression on first-line therapy if a lesion can be accessed for sampling and testing. • Testing in the Setting of Progression on Targeted Therapy: For many of the above listed analytes, there is growing recognition of the molecular mechanisms of resistance to therapy. Re-testing of a sample from a tumor that is actively progressing while exposed to targeted therapy can shed light on appropriate next therapeutic steps: ◊ For patients with an underlying EGFR sensitizing mutation who have been treated with EGFR TKI, minimum appropriate testing includes highsensitivity evaluation for p.T790M; when there is no evidence of p.T790M, testing for alternate mechanisms of resistance (MET amplification, ERBB2 amplification) may be used to direct patients for additional therapies. The presence of p.T790M can direct patients to third-generation EGFR TKI therapy. – Assays for the detection of EGFR p.T790M should be designed to have an analytic sensitivity of a minimum of 5% allelic fraction. The original
sensitizing mutation can be utilized as an internal control in many assays to determine whether a p.T790M is within the range of detection if present as a sub-clonal event. ◊ For patients with underlying ALK rearrangement who have been treated with ALK TKI, it is unclear whether identification of specific tyrosine kinase domain mutation can identify appropriate next steps in therapy, although some preliminary data suggest that specific kinase domain mutations can impact next line of therapy. ◊ Broad genomic profiling may be the most informative approach to examining potential mechanisms of resistance, which may require more than one instance of such profiling over the course of an individual patient’s therapy. • Testing in the setting of a limited number of pulmonary nodules can aid in distinguishing separate primary lung carcinoma versus intrapulmonary metastatic disease. Studies to explore tumor relatedness by testing tissue from separately sampled lesions using a broad gene coverage NGS approach suggest it may be superior to histopathologic assessment. Tumor pairs exhibiting entirely non-overlapping, unique mutations are considered clonally unrelated separate primary lung cancers, even if histologically similar. Tumors that share multiple (≥2) mutations are more likely to be clonally related; however, this may depend on the extent to which any individual mutation is extremely common in NSCLC and whether identified alterations are driver or passenger alterations. Results in which no mutations or only one mutation are identified are not informative for this evaluation.

Note: All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated. Clinical Trials: NCCN believes that the best management of any patient with cancer is in a clinical trial. Participation in clinical trials is especially encouraged.

PRINCIPLES OF MOLECULAR AND BIOMARKER ANALYSIS
• PD-L1 (programmed death ligand 1): PD-L1 is a co-regulatory molecule that can be expressed on tumor cells and inhibit T-cell–mediated cell death. T-cells express PD-1, a negative regulator, which binds to ligands including PD-L1 (CD274) or PD-L2 (CD273). In the presence of PD-L1, T-cell activity is suppressed. Checkpoint inhibitor antibodies block the PD-1 and PD-L1 interaction, thereby improving the antitumor effects of endogenous T cells. IHC for PD-L1 can be utilized to identify disease most likely to respond to first-line anti PD-1/PD-L1. ◊ Various antibody clones have been developed for IHC analysis of PD-L1 expression, and while several are comparable regarding intensity and proportion of cells stained, some are not. – The definition of positive and negative testing is dependent on the individual antibody, clone, and platform deployed, which may be unique to each checkpoint inhibitor therapy. The approval of multiple different assays for PD-L1 has raised concern among both pathologists and oncologists. – While some clones for PD-L1 IHC are FDA-approved for specific indications, use of multiple IHC tests is not necessary, provided any individual IHC test has been internally validated for comparability for categorical results against the FDA-approved clone. – Interpretation of PD-L1 IHC in NSCLC is typically focused on the proportion of tumor cells expressing membranous staining at any level and therefore is a linear variable; scoring systems may be different in other tumor types. ◊ Although PD-L1 expression can be elevated in patients with an oncogenic driver, targeted therapy for the oncogenic driver should take precedence over treatment with an immune checkpoint inhibitor.
• Plasma Cell-Free/Circulating Tumor DNA Testing: Cell-free/circulating tumor DNA testing should not be used in lieu of a histologic tissue diagnosis. Some laboratories offer testing for molecular alterations examining nucleic acids in peripheral circulation, most commonly in processed plasma
(sometimes referred to as "liquid biopsy"). Studies have demonstrated cell-free tumor DNA testing to generally have very high specificity, but significantly compromised sensitivity, with up
to a 30% false-negative rate; however, data support complementary testing to reduce turnaround time and increase yield of targetable alteration detection. Published guidelines elaborating standards for analytical performance characteristics of cell-free tumor DNA have not been established, and in contrast to tissue-based testing, no guidelines exist regarding the recommended performance characteristics of this type of testing. Cell-free tumor DNA testing can identify alterations that are unrelated to a lesion of interest, for example, clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP). The use of cell-free/circulating tumor DNA testing can be considered in specific clinical circumstances, most notably: ◊ If a patient is medically unfit for invasive tissue sampling ◊ In the initial diagnostic setting, if following pathologic confirmation of a NSCLC diagnosis there is insufficient material for molecular analysis,
cell-free/circulating tumor DNA should be used only if follow-up tissue-based analysis is planned for all patients in which an oncogenic driver is not identified (see NSCL-18 for oncogenic drivers with available targeted therapy options). ◊ In the initial diagnostic setting, if tissue-based testing does not completely assess all recommended biomarkers owing to tissue quantity or testing methodologies available, consider repeat biopsy and/or cell-free/circulating tumor DNA testing.

a Albumin-bound paclitaxel may be substituted for either paclitaxel or docetaxel in patients who have experienced hypersensitivity reactions after receiving paclitaxel or docetaxel despite premedication, or for patients where the standard premedications (ie, dexamethasone, H2 blockers, H1 blockers) are contraindicated.
b Carboplatin-based regimens are often used for patients with comorbidities or those who cannot tolerate cisplatin.
C If first-line systemic therapy completed before treatment for an actionable mutation, and disease has progressed, see Subsequent Therapy NSCL-K 4 of 5.

d Contraindications for treatment with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors may include active or previously

documented autoimmune disease and/or current use of immunosuppressive agents; some

oncogenic drivers (ie, EGFR exon 19 deletion or L858R, ALK rearrangements) have been

shown to be associated with less benefit from PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. e If progression on PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor, using a PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor is not recommended.

f An FDA-approved biosimilar is an appropriate substitute for bevacizumab.

g Bevacizumab should be given until progression.

h Any regimen with a high risk of thrombocytopenia and the potential risk of bleeding should be

used with caution in combination with bevacizumab.

i Criteria for treatment with bevacizumab: non-squamous NSCLC, and no recent history of

hemoptysis. Bevacizumab should not be given as a single agent, unless as maintenance if

initially used with chemotherapy.
