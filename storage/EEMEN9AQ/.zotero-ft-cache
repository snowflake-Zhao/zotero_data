NCCN Guidelines Index Table of Contents Discussion

Updates in Version 1.2023 of the NCCN Guidelines for Esophageal and Esophagogastric Junction Cancers from Version 5.2022 include:

Squamous Cell Carcinoma and Adenocarcinoma Principles of Systemic Therapy ESOPH-F 1 of 20 • 1st bullet revised: "...recommended for advanced esophageal
adenocarcinoma, and EGJ adenocarcinoma, SCC of the esophagus, and gastric adenocarcinoma may be used interchangeably (except as indicated). Systemic therapy regimens recommended for advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus have been separately included." • 3rd bullet revised: "...added to first-line chemotherapy for advanced HER2 overexpression positive adenocarcinoma."
ESOPH-F 2 of 20 • The following statement was moved to a separate page. Previously,
it was a footnote that was listed on all of the dosing schedule pages: " The selection, dosing, and administration of anticancer agents and the management of associated toxicities are complex. Modifications of drug dose and schedule and initiation of supportive care interventions are often necessary because of expected toxicities and because of individual patient variability, prior treatment, nutritional status, and comorbidity. The optimal delivery of anticancer agents therefore requires a health care delivery team experienced in the use of anticancer agents and the management of associated toxicities in patients with cancer."
ESOPH-F 3 of 20 • Definitive Chemoradiation: Fluorouracil and cisplatin (category 1) moved
from Preferred Regimens to Other Recommended Regimens. • Postoperative Therapy table: "Fluoropyrimidine (infusional fluorouracil or
capecitabine) before and after fluoropyrimidine-based chemoradiation" was added under "Other Recommended Regimens". Previously it was listed in the "Postoperative Chemoradiation" table. • The "Postoperative Chemoradiation" table was removed. • The table for "Preoperative Chemotherapy (Only for adenocarcinoma of the thoracic esophagus or EGJ) and its corresponding regimen "Fluorouracil and cisplatin (category 2B)" was removed. • Footnote regarding Fluorouracil, leucovorin, oxaliplatin, and docetaxel (FLOT) was removed: Due to toxicity, three-drug regimens are recommended only in select patients who are medically fit.

Principles of Systemic Therapy for Unresectable Locally Advanced, Recurrent or Metastatic Disease ESOPH-F 4 of 20 • General: The systemic therapy tables were extensively revised, which
included changing the layout to distinguish between adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma and changing the NCCN Category of Preference designations for some regimens in the tables. Several regimens were also added and/or removed from the tables. Changes below are not exhaustive. • First-Line Therapy; Adenocarcinoma
◊ Header revised: Oxaliplatin is generally preferred over cisplatin due to lower toxicity. (Also for squamous cell carcinoma)
◊ Preferred Regimens – HER2 overexpression positive ▪ "Fluoropyrimidine (fluorouracil or capecitabine) and oxaliplatin and trastuzumab and pembrolizumab" moved from "Other Recommended Regimens" to Preferred. ▪ "Fluoropyrimidine (fluorouracil or capecitabine) and cisplatin and trastuzumab and pembrolizumab" moved from "Other Recommended Regimens" to Preferred. – Other Recommended Regimens ▪ Revised: Paclitaxel with or without cisplatin or carboplatin or cisplatin. (Also for squamous cell carcinoma) ▪ Docetaxel, carboplatin, and fluorouracil (category 2B) removed as an option. (Also for squamous cell carcinoma)
ESOPH-F 6 of 20 • Second-Line or Subsequent Therapy; Adenocarcinoma Useful in Certain Circumstances
◊ Dabrafenib and trametinib for BRAF V600E mutated tumors added as an option. (Also for squamous cell carcinoma)
◊ Selpercatinib for RET gene fusion-positive tumors added as an option. (also for squamous cell carcinoma)

See Principles of Palliative/Best Supportive Care (ESOPH-H).

q For pTis and pT1a the level of evidence for ablation of SCC after ER is low. However, additional ablation may be needed if there is multifocal high-grade dysplasia (HGD)/carcinoma in situ. Ablation may not be needed if all lesions are completely excised. For references, See Principles of Endoscopic Staging and Therapy (ESOPH-A).
r ER followed by ablation may be used to completely eliminate residual dysplasia. s Esophagectomy is indicated for patients with extensive carcinoma in situ (pTis
or HGD) or pT1a, especially nodular disease that is not adequately controlled by ablation or ER followed by ablation. t Transhiatal or transthoracic, or minimally invasive; gastric reconstruction preferred. u Feeding jejunostomy for postoperative nutritional support, generally preferred. v Definitive chemoradiation may be an appropriate option for patients who decline surgery; see (ESOPH-8).

Although some endoscopy procedures can be performed without anesthesia, most are performed with the aid of conscious sedation administered by the endoscopist or assisting nurse or deeper anesthesia (monitored anesthesia care) provided by the endoscopist, nurse, a nurse anesthetist, or an anesthesiologist. Some patients who are at risk of aspiration during endoscopy may require general anesthesia. Diagnosis • Diagnostic and surveillance endoscopies are performed with the goal of determining the presence and location of esophageal neoplasia and
to biopsy any suspicious lesions. Thus, an adequate endoscopic exam addresses both of these components. • The location of the tumor relative to the teeth and EGJ, the length of the tumor, the extent of circumferential involvement, and the degree
of obstruction should be carefully recorded to assist with treatment planning. If present, the location, length, and circumferential extent of Barrett esophagus should be characterized in accordance with the Prague criteria,1 and mucosal nodules should be carefully documented. • High-resolution endoscopic imaging and narrow-band imaging are presently available and may enhance visualization during endoscopy, with improved detection of lesions in Barrett and non-Barrett esophagus and stomach.2 • Multiple biopsies, six to eight, using standard size endoscopy forceps should be performed to provide sufficient material for histologic and molecular interpretation.3 Larger forceps are recommended during surveillance endoscopy of Barrett esophagus for the detection of dysplasia.4 • ER of focal nodules should be performed in the setting of early-stage disease to provide accurate depth of invasion, degree of differentiation, and the presence of vascular and/or lymphatic invasion.5 ER should be considered in the evaluation of areas of Barrett esophagus associated with high-grade dysplasia (HGD) and also patches of squamous cell dysplasia, specifically focusing on areas of nodularity or ulceration. Pathologists should be asked to provide an assessment of the depth of tumor infiltration into the lamina propria, muscularis mucosa, and submucosa; invasion of vascular structures and nerves; and the presence of tumor or dysplastic cells at the lateral and deep margins. ER may be fully therapeutic when a lesion is fully removed and histopathologic assessment demonstrates extension no deeper than the superficial submucosa and negative deep margins; however, patients with poorly differentiated tumors, deep submucosal invasion, and/or LVI are at significantly higher risk of lymph node involvement.6,7,8 • Cytologic brushings or washings are rarely adequate in the initial diagnosis.

PRINCIPLES OF ENDOSCOPIC STAGING AND THERAPY Staging • EUS performed prior to any treatment is important in the initial clinical staging of neoplastic disease. Careful attention to ultrasound images
provides evidence of depth of tumor invasion (T designation), presence of abnormal or enlarged lymph nodes likely to harbor cancer (N designation), and occasionally signs of distant spread, such as lesions in surrounding organs (M designation).9 • Hypoechoic (dark) expansion of the esophageal wall layers identifies the location of tumor, with gradual loss of the layered pattern of the normal esophageal wall corresponding with greater depths of tumor penetration, correlating with higher T-categories. A dark expansion of layers 1–3 corresponds with infiltration of the superficial and deep mucosa plus the submucosal, T1 disease. Isolated thickening of the mucosal layer alone may be difficult to appreciate resulting in loss of sensitivity of EUS for superficial disease. Similarly, standard EUS scopes, with 7.5–12 MHz frequency transducers, may lack the resolution to accurately distinguish the penetration of the tumor through the muscularis mucosa, or superficial from deep penetration of the submucosa.9,10 A dark expansion of layers 1–4 correlates with penetration into the muscularis propria, T2 disease, and expansion beyond the smooth outer border of the muscularis propria correlates with invasion of the adventitia, T3 disease. Loss of a bright tissue plane between the area of tumor and surrounding structures such as the pleura, diaphragm, and pericardium correlates with T4a disease, while invasion of surrounding structures such as the trachea, aorta, lungs, heart, liver, or pancreas correlates with T4b disease. • For small, nodular lesions ≤2 cm, ER is encouraged as it provides a more accurate depth of invasion than the results of EUS.10 A decision to proceed to further therapy such as resection or ablation, or to consider the ER completely therapeutic would depend on the final pathologic assessment of the resection specimen. • Mediastinal and perigastric lymph nodes are readily seen by EUS, and the identification of enlarged, hypoechoic (dark), homogeneous, wellcircumscribed, rounded structures in these areas correlates with the presence of malignant or inflammatory lymph nodes. The accuracy of this diagnosis is significantly increased with the combination of features, but is also confirmed with the use of fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy for cytology assessment.11 FNA of suspicious lymph nodes should be performed if it can be performed without traversing an area of primary tumor or major blood vessels, and if it will impact treatment decisions. The pre-procedure review of CT and FDG-PET scans is recommended, when available, prior to esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD)/EUS, to become fully familiar with the nodal distribution for possible FNA. • Obstructing tumors may increase the risk of perforation while performing staging EUS exams. The use of wire-guided EUS probes, or miniprobes, may permit EUS staging with a lower risk of perforation. In certain cases, dilating the malignant stricture to allow completion of staging may be appropriate, but there is increased risk of perforation after dilation.

NCCN Guidelines Index Table of Contents Discussion

PRINCIPLES OF ENDOSCOPIC STAGING AND THERAPY Primary Treatment • The goal of endoscopic therapy [by endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR), endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD), and/or ablation] is the
complete removal or eradication of early-stage disease (pTis, pT1a, selected superficial pT1b without LVI) and pre-neoplastic tissue (Barrett esophagus). • Early-stage disease, Tis, also known as HGD, needs to be fully characterized, including evaluating presence of nodularity, lateral spread, and ruling out multifocal disease, as well as ruling out lymph node metastases by EUS in select higher risk cases. This is important to permit decisions on endoscopic therapy with ablative methods such as radiofrequency ablation (RFA), cryoablation, photodynamic therapy (PDT), and/or ER.12-15 Areas of nodularity or ulceration should be resected rather than ablated. Completely flat, small lesions (≤2 cm) of squamous cell HGD/Tis (carcinoma in situ) and Barrett esophagus associated with flat HGD should be treated by ER as it provides more accurate histologic assessment of the lesion. Larger flat lesions (>2 cm) can be treated effectively by ER, but this is associated with greater risk of complications. Such lesions can be effectively treated by ablation alone, but there are very limited data on treating squamous cell HGD by ablation alone.12,13,16-19 • Lesions that are found to be pathologically limited to the lamina propria or muscularis mucosae (pT1a), or the superficial submucosa (pT1b), in the absence of evidence of lymph node metastases, LVI, or poor differentiation grade can be treated with full ER.20-22 However, a thorough and detailed discussion regarding comparative risk of esophagectomy versus potential for concurrent nodal disease should be undertaken, preferably between patient and surgeon, especially in cases with larger tumors or deeper invasion. Ablative therapy of residual Barrett esophagus should be performed following ER.17 Complete eradication of Barrett esophagus can also be performed with more aggressive application of EMR (widefield EMR) or ESD at the initial intervention, if necessary to completely resect an area of superficial tumor or mucosal nodularity ≤2 cm in maximal dimension.23 • The level of evidence for ablation of SCC after ER is low. However, additional ablation may be needed if there is multifocal HGD/carcinoma in situ elsewhere in the esophagus. Ablation may not be needed for lesions that are completely excised.16,24,25 • Endoscopic therapy is considered “preferred” for patients with limited early-stage disease (Tis and T1a, ≤2 cm, and well or moderately differentiated carcinoma), because the risk of harboring lymph node metastases, local or distant recurrence, and death from esophageal cancer is low following endoscopic therapy.17

PRINCIPLES OF ENDOSCOPIC STAGING AND THERAPY Treatment of Symptoms • Esophageal dilation can be performed with the use of dilating balloons or bougies to temporarily relieve obstruction from tumors, or
treatment-related strictures. Caution should be exercised to avoid overdilation, to minimize the risk of perforation. • Long-term palliation of dysphagia can be achieved with endoscopic tumor ablation by Nd:YAG laser, PDT and cryoablation, or endoscopic
and radiographic-assisted insertion of expandable metal or plastic stents.26,27 • Long-term palliation of anorexia, dysphagia, or malnutrition may be achieved with endoscopic or radiographic-assisted placement of feeding
gastrostomy or jejunostomy. The placement of a gastrostomy in the preoperative setting may compromise the gastric vasculature, thereby interfering with the creation of the gastric conduit in the reconstruction during esophagectomy and should be avoided. Post-Treatment Surveillance • Consider deferring assessment endoscopy with biopsy to 6 weeks or later after completion of preoperative therapy in patients whom avoidance of surgery is being considered.28 • EUS exams performed after chemotherapy or radiation therapy have a reduced ability to accurately determine the present stage of disease.29 Similarly, biopsies performed after chemotherapy or radiation therapy may not accurately diagnose the presence of residual disease.28 • Endoscopic surveillance following definitive treatment of esophageal cancer requires careful attention to detail for mucosal surface changes, and multiple biopsies of any visualized abnormalities. Strictures should be biopsied to rule out neoplastic cause. EUS-guided FNA should be performed if suspicious lymph nodes or areas of wall thickening are seen on cross-sectional imaging. • Endoscopic surveillance after ablative therapy or ER of early-stage esophageal cancer should continue after completion of treatment (See ESOPH-I). Biopsies should be taken of the neosquamous mucosa even in the absence of mucosal abnormalities as dysplasia may occasionally be present beneath the squamous mucosa. • Endoscopic surveillance should also include a search for the presence of Barrett esophagus and four-quadrant biopsies to detect residual or recurrent dysplasia. The ablation of residual or recurrent high-grade and low-grade dysplasia using RFA or cryoablation should be considered. • Patients who have received therapeutic ER should have endoscopic surveillance (See ESOPH-I).

PRINCIPLES OF PATHOLOGIC REVIEW AND BIOMARKER TESTING Assessment of Treatment Response Response of the primary tumor to previous chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy should be reported. Residual primary tumor in the resection specimen following neoadjuvant therapy is associated with shorter overall survival for both adenocarcinoma4-6 and SCC of the esophagus.7 Although scoring systems for tumor response in esophageal cancer have not been uniformly adopted, in general, three-category systems provide good reproducibility among pathologists.6,8,9 The modified Ryan scheme in the CAP Cancer Protocol for Esophageal Carcinoma (available at http://www.cap.org)8,9 should be used. Sizable pools of acellular mucin may be present after chemoradiation but should not be interpreted as representing residual tumor. Although the system described by Wu was originally limited to assessment of the primary tumor, it is recommended that lymph nodes be included in the regression score10 because of the impact of residual nodal metastases on survival.

PRINCIPLES OF PATHOLOGIC REVIEW AND BIOMARKER TESTING Assessment of Overexpression or Amplification of HER2 in Esophageal and EGJ Cancers For patients with inoperable locally advanced, recurrent, or metastatic adenocarcinoma of the esophagus or EGJ for whom trastuzumabi therapy is being considered, assessment for tumor HER2 overexpression using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or other in situ hybridization (ISH) methods is recommended.11 NGS offers the opportunity to assess numerous mutations simultaneously, along with other molecular events such as amplification, deletions, tumor mutation burden, and MSI status. NGS can be considered instead of sequential testing for single biomarkers when limited diagnostic tissue is available or when the patient is unable to undergo a traditional biopsy. The use of IHC/ISH should be considered first, followed by NGS testing as appropriate. Repeat biomarker testing may be considered at clinical or radiologic progression for patients with advanced/metastatic esophageal/EGJ adenocarcinoma.

PRINCIPLES OF PATHOLOGIC REVIEW AND BIOMARKER TESTING Microsatellite Instability (MSI) or Mismatch Repair (MMR) Testingl • Testing for MSI by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)/NGS or MMR by IHC should be considered on locally advanced, recurrent, or metastatic
esophageal and EGJ cancers in patients who are candidates for treatment with programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) inhibitors.12 The testing is performed on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue and results are interpreted as MSI-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repairdeficient (dMMR) in accordance with CAP DNA Mismatch Repair Biomarker Reporting Guidelines.13 Testing should be performed only in Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-approved laboratories. Patients with MSI-H or dMMR tumors should be referred to a genetics counselor for further assessment in the appropriate clinical context. MMR Interpretation
◊ No loss of nuclear expression of MMR proteins: No evidence of dMMR (low probability of MSI-H) ◊ Loss of nuclear expression of one or more MMR proteins: dMMR MSI Interpretation ◊ MSI-stable (MSS) ◊ MSI-low (MSI-L)
– 1%–29% of the markers exhibit instability – 1 of the 5 National Cancer Institute (NCI) or mononucleotide markers exhibits instability ◊ MSI-H – ≥30% of the markers exhibit instability – 2 or more of the 5 NCI or mononucleotide markers exhibit instability PD-L1 Testing • PD-L1 testing may be considered on locally advanced, recurrent, or metastatic esophageal and EGJ cancers in patients who are candidates for treatment with PD-1 inhibitors. A companion diagnostic test for use on FFPE tissue should be used in identifying patients for treatment with PD-1 inhibitors. PD-L1 testing should be performed only in CLIA-approved laboratories. • Assessment of PD-L1 Protein Expression in Esophageal and EGJ Cancers This is a qualitative immunohistochemical assay using anti–PD-L1 antibodies for the detection of PD-L1 protein in FFPE tissues from esophageal or EGJ cancers. A minimum of 100 tumor cells must be present in the PD-L1–stained slide for the specimen to be considered adequate for PD-L1 evaluation. A specimen is considered to have PD-L1 expression if the combined positive score (CPS) ≥1. CPS is the number of PD-L1 staining cells (ie, tumor cells, lymphocytes, macrophages) divided by the total number of viable tumor cells, multiplied by 100.

l PCR/NGS for MSI and IHC for MMR proteins measure different biological effects caused by dMMR function.

PRINCIPLES OF PATHOLOGIC REVIEW AND BIOMARKER TESTING Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS): • At present, several targeted therapeutic agents, trastuzumab,i pembrolizumab/nivolumab,m and entrectinib/larotrectinib, selpercatinib,
and dabrafenib/trametinib, have been approved by the FDA for use in esophageal and EGJ cancers. Trastuzumab is based on testing for HER2 overexpression. Pembrolizumab/nivolumab are based on testing for MSI by PCR or NGS/MMR by IHC, PD-L1 immunohistochemical expression, or high tumor mutational burden (TMB) by NGS. The FDA granted approval for the use of select TRK inhibitors for NTRK gene fusion-positive solid tumors, and selpercatinib for RET gene fusion-positive tumors. Dabrafenib/trametinib has been approved for tumors with BRAF V600E mutations. When limited tissue is available for testing, or the patient is unable to undergo a traditional biopsy, sequential testing of single biomarkers or use of limited molecular diagnostic panels may quickly exhaust the sample. In these scenarios, comprehensive genomic profiling via a validated NGS assay performed in a CLIA-approved laboratory may be used for the identification of HER2 amplification, MSI status, MMR deficiency, TMB, NTRK gene fusions, RET gene fusions, and BRAF V600E mutations. The use of IHC/ ISH/targeted PCR should be considered first followed by NGS testing as appropriate. Liquid Biopsy14,15 • The genomic alterations of solid cancers may be identified by evaluating circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in the blood, hence a form of “liquid biopsy.” Liquid biopsy is being used more frequently in patients with advanced disease, particularly those who are unable to have a clinical biopsy for disease surveillance and management. The detection of mutations/alterations in DNA shed from esophageal and EGJ carcinomas can identify targetable alterations or the evolution of clones with altered treatment response profiles. Therefore, for patients who have metastatic or advanced esophageal/esophagogastric cancers who may be unable to undergo a traditional biopsy or for disease progression monitoring, testing using a validated NGS-based comprehensive genomic profiling assay performed in a CLIA-approved laboratory may be considered. A negative result should be interpreted with caution, as this does not exclude the presence of tumor mutations or amplifications.

i An FDA-approved biosimilar is an appropriate substitute for trastuzumab. m See NCCN Guidelines for Management of Immunotherapy-Related Toxicities.

NCCN Guidelines Index Table of Contents Discussion

PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY

• Prior to surgery, clinical staging should be performed to assess resectability with CT scan of the chest and abdomen, whole body FDG-PET (integrated FDG-PET/CT is preferred), and EUS.
• Prior to starting therapy all patients should be assessed by an esophageal surgeon for physiologic ability to undergo esophageal resection.1 Esophageal resection should be considered for all patients who are physiologically fit with resectable esophageal cancer (>5 cm from cricopharyngeus).
• Siewert Classification Siewert tumor type should be assessed in all patients with adenocarcinomas involving the EGJ.2,3
◊ Siewert Type I: adenocarcinoma of the lower esophagus with the epicenter located within 1 cm to 5 cm above the anatomic EGJ. ◊ Siewert Type II: true carcinoma of the cardia with the tumor epicenter within 1 cm above and 2 cm below the EGJ. ◊ Siewert Type III: subcardial carcinoma with the tumor epicenter between 2 cm and 5 cm below the EGJ, which infiltrates the EGJ and
lower esophagus from below. The treatment of Siewert types I and II is as described in the NCCN Guidelines for Esophageal and EGJ Cancers, and a variety of surgical
approaches may be used. Siewert type III lesions are considered gastric cancers, and thus the NCCN Guidelines for Gastric Cancer should be followed. In some
cases additional esophageal resection may be needed in order to obtain adequate margins.2,4,5 • Laparoscopy may be useful in select patients in detecting radiographically occult metastatic disease, especially in patients with Siewert II
and III tumors.1 • Positive peritoneal cytology (performed in the absence of visible peritoneal implants) is associated with poor prognosis and is defined as M1
disease. In patients with advanced tumors, clinical T3 or N+ disease should be considered for laparoscopic staging with peritoneal washings. • Cervical or cervicothoracic esophageal carcinomas <5 cm from the cricopharyngeus should be treated with definitive chemoradiation. • Resectable esophageal or EGJ cancer: T1a tumors, defined as tumors involving the mucosa but not invading the submucosa, may be considered for EMR + ablation or
esophagectomy in experienced centers.6-10 Tumors in the submucosa (T1b) or deeper may be treated with esophagectomy. T1–T3 tumors are resectable even with regional nodal metastases (N+), although bulky; multi-station lymphatic involvement is a relative
contraindication to surgery, to be considered in conjunction with age and performance status. T4a tumors with involvement of pericardium, pleura, or diaphragm are resectable. • Unresectable esophageal cancer: cT4b tumors with involvement of the heart, great vessels, trachea, or adjacent organs including liver, pancreas, lung, and spleen are
unresectable. Most patients with multi-station, bulky lymphadenopathy should be considered unresectable, although lymph node involvement should be
considered in conjunction with other factors, including age, performance status, and response to therapy. Patients with EGJ and supraclavicular lymph node involvement should be considered unresectable. Patients with distant (including nonregional lymph nodes) metastases (stage IV) are unresectable.

Note: All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated. Clinical Trials: NCCN believes that the best management of any patient with cancer is in a clinical trial. Participation in clinical trials is especially encouraged.

PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY
• The type of esophageal resection is dictated by the location of the tumor, the available choices for conduit, as well as by the surgeon's experience and preference and the patient's preference.
• In patients who are unable to swallow well enough to maintain nutrition during induction therapy, esophageal dilatation or a feeding jejunostomy tube (J-tube) are preferred to a gastrostomy (which may compromise the integrity of gastric conduit for reconstruction).
• Acceptable operative approaches for resectable esophageal or EGJ cancer: Ivor Lewis esophagogastrectomy (laparotomy + right thoracotomy) McKeown esophagogastrectomy (right thoracotomy + laparotomy + cervical anastomosis) Minimally invasive Ivor Lewis esophagogastrectomy (laparoscopy + limited right thoracotomy)11,12 Minimally invasive McKeown esophagogastrectomy (right thoracoscopy + limited laparotomy/laparoscopy + cervical anastomosis) Transhiatal esophagogastrectomy (laparotomy + cervical anastomosis) Robotic minimally invasive esophagogastrectomy Left transthoracic or thoracoabdominal approaches with anastomosis in chest or neck
• Acceptable conduits: Gastric (preferred) Colon Jejunum
• Acceptable lymph node dissections13: Standard Extended (en-bloc)
• In patients undergoing esophagectomy without induction chemoradiation, at least 15 lymph nodes should be removed and assessed to achieve adequate nodal staging. The optimum number of nodes after preoperative chemoradiation is unknown, although similar lymph node resection is recommended.14
• Patients who develop localized, resectable esophageal cancer after definitive chemoradiation can be considered for esophagectomy if they do not have distant recurrence.15
• Patients with potentially resectable esophageal cancer should undergo multidisciplinary review. Esophageal resection, EMR, and other ablative techniques should be performed in high-volume esophageal centers by experienced surgeons and endoscopists.16

PRINCIPLES OF GENETIC RISK ASSESSMENT FOR ESOPHAGEAL AND EGJ CANCERS

Criteria for Further Risk Evaluation for High-Risk Syndromes:

• Referral to a cancer genetics professional is recommended for an individual with a known high-risk syndrome associated with esophageal

and EGJ cancers.

• Although early age of onset, multiple family members with the same or related cancer, and individuals with multiple primary cancers are all

signs of hereditary cancer, specific referral guidelines for esophageal and EGJ cancers risk assessment are not possible at this time.

• The most efficient strategy to identify a causative gene mutation in a family is to test a close relative with cancer. If the relative is either

unwilling or unavailable for testing, then consider testing of an unaffected relative. A detailed discussion of genetic counseling and testing

can be found in the NCCN Guidelines for Genetic/Familial High-Risk Assessment: Colorectal and NCCN Guidelines for Genetic/Familial High-

Risk Assessment: Breast, Ovarian, and Pancreatic.

Hereditary Cancer Predisposition Syndromes Associated with an Increased Risk for Esophageal and EGJ Cancers • Esophageal Cancer, Tylosis with Non-epidermolytic Palmoplantar Keratoderma (PPK), and Howel-Evans Syndrome1,2

Tylosis with esophageal cancer (TEC) is a very rare condition with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance and is caused by germline

mutations in the RHBDF2 gene. Individuals with germline RHBDF2 mutations have an increased risk for SCC of the esophagus. PPK is

divided into diffuse, punctate, or focal patterns of skin thickening on palms and soles. The non-epidermolytic PPK is associated with high

risk of SCC of the middle and distal esophagus. • Familial Barrett Esophagus3

Familial Barrett esophagus (FBE) includes adenocarcinoma of the esophagus and EGJ. Development of Barrett esophagus is strongly

associated with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). FBE may be associated with one or more autosomally inherited dominant

susceptibility alleles. Several candidate genes have been identified, but not validated. • Bloom Syndrome4

Bloom syndrome (BS) is characterized by mutations of the BLM gene at 15q26.1 and is associated with strikingly elevated sister chromatid

exchange rates in all cells. Chromosomal quadraradials with breakage may be used to diagnose individuals with BS who often are affected

by acute myeloid leukemia (AML), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), or lymphoid neoplasms at an early age, but then also cancers

affecting many organs including the SCC of the esophagus after 20 years of age. • Fanconi Anemia1,2

The genes involved in Fanconi anemia (FA) include FA complementation groups A–E, with FA-A (FANCA) located at 16q24.3; FA-B

(FANCB), unknown; FA-C (FANCC) at 9q22.3; FA-D (FANCD) at 3p26–p22; and FA-E (FANCE), unknown. Mutations in FANCA and FANCC

have been identified. Individuals are identified by pancytopenia and chromosome breakage and hematologic abnormalities, including

anemia, bleeding, and easy bruising. Increased frequency of SCC of the esophagus as well as other squamous epithelium is observed.

Karyotyping does not identify individuals with FA, but enhanced chromosome breakage with mitomycin C can identify homozygotes but

not heterozygotes.

Screening Recommendations
Screening by upper gastrointestinal endoscopy is recommended in family members with tylosis after 20 years of age. • Potential family history of Barrett esophagus, esophageal
adenocarcinoma, or EGJ adenocarcinoma should be determined for patients presenting with GERD, especially Caucasian males older than 40 years of age. • Screening for Barrett esophagus by upper gastrointestinal endoscopy is recommended in family members with FBE after 40 years of age, especially if the individual has a history of GERD. Screening for GERD with or without endoscopy to screen for early cancer after 20 years of age may be considered.

Fanconi anemia (FA)1,2

FANCD1, BRCA2, Autosomal FANCN (PALB2) recessive

Endoscopy of the esophagus may be considered as a screening strategy in individuals identified with FA.

PRINCIPLES OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY TEAM APPROACH FOR ESOPHAGOGASTRIC CANCERS Category 1 evidence supports the notion that the combined modality therapy is effective for patients with localized esophagogastric cancer.1,2,3 The NCCN Panel believes in an infrastructure that encourages multidisciplinary treatment decision-making by members of all disciplines taking care of this group of patients. The combined modality therapy for patients with localized esophagogastric cancer may be optimally delivered when the following elements are in place: • The involved institution and individuals from relevant disciplines are committed to jointly reviewing the detailed data on patients on a regular
basis. Frequent meetings (either once a week or once every two weeks) are encouraged. • Optimally at each meeting, all relevant disciplines should be encouraged to participate and these may include: surgical oncology, medical
oncology, gastroenterology, radiation oncology, radiology, and pathology. In addition, the presence of nutritional services, social workers, nurses, palliative care specialists, and other supporting disciplines are also desirable. • All long-term therapeutic strategies are best developed after adequate staging procedures are completed, but ideally prior to any therapy that is rendered. • Joint review of the actual medical data is more effective than reading reports for making sound therapy decisions. • A brief documentation of the consensus recommendation(s) by the multidisciplinary team for an individual patient may prove useful. • The recommendations made by the multidisciplinary team may be considered advisory to the primary group of treating physicians of the particular patient. • Re-presentation of select patient outcomes after therapy is rendered may be an effective educational method for the entire multidisciplinary team. • A periodic formal review of relevant literature during the course of the multidisciplinary meeting is highly encouraged.

PRINCIPLES OF SYSTEMIC THERAPY • Systemic therapy regimens recommended for advanced esophageal adenocarcinoma, EGJ adenocarcinoma, and gastric adenocarcinoma
may be used interchangeably (except as indicated). Systemic therapy regimens recommended for advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus have been separately included. • Regimens should be chosen in the context of performance status (PS), comorbidities, and toxicity profile. • Trastuzumaba should be added to first-line chemotherapy for advanced HER2 overexpression positive adenocarcinoma. • Two-drug cytotoxic regimens are preferred for patients with advanced disease because of lower toxicity. The use of three cytotoxic drugs in a regimen should be reserved for patients who are medically fit with excellent PS and easy access to frequent toxicity evaluations. • Modifications of category 1 regimen or use of category 2A or 2B regimens may be preferred (as indicated), with evidence supporting more favorable toxicity profile without compromising efficacy.1 • Doses and schedules for any regimen that is not derived from category 1 evidence is a suggestion, and subject to appropriate modifications depending on the circumstances. • Alternate combinations and schedules of cytotoxics based on the availability of the agents, practice preferences, and contraindications are permitted. • Preoperative chemoradiation is the preferred approach for localized adenocarcinoma of the thoracic esophagus or EGJ.2 Perioperative chemotherapy is an alternative option for distal esophagus and EGJ.3,4 • In the adjuvant setting, upon completion of chemotherapy or chemoradiation, patients should be monitored for any long-term treatmentrelated complications.

PRINCIPLES OF SYSTEMIC THERAPY

The selection, dosing, and administration of anticancer agents and the management of associated toxicities are complex. Modifications of drug dose and schedule and initiation of supportive care interventions are often necessary because of expected toxicities and because of individual patient variability, prior treatment, nutritional status, and comorbidity. The optimal delivery of anticancer agents therefore requires a health care delivery team experienced in the use of anticancer agents and the management of associated toxicities in patients with cancer.

Note: All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated. Clinical Trials: NCCN believes that the best management of any patient with cancer is in a clinical trial. Participation in clinical trials is especially encouraged.

NCCN Guidelines Index Table of Contents Discussion

PRINCIPLES OF RADIATION THERAPY General Guidelines • Treatment recommendations should be made after joint consultation and/or discussion by a multidisciplinary team including surgical,
radiation, and medical oncologists, radiologists, gastroenterologists, and pathologists. • CT scans, barium swallow, EUS, endoscopy reports, and FDG-PET or FDG-PET/CT scans, when available, should be reviewed by the
multidisciplinary team. This will allow an informed determination of treatment volume and field borders prior to simulation. • All available information from pre-treatment diagnostic studies should be used to determine the target volume. • In general, Siewert I and II tumors should be managed with radiation therapy guidelines applicable to esophageal and EGJ cancers. Siewert
III tumors patients may receive perioperative chemotherapy or preoperative chemoradiation depending on institutional preference, and are generally more appropriately managed with radiation according to guidelines applicable to gastric cancers. These recommendations may be modified depending on the location of the bulk of the tumor. Simulation and Treatment Planning • CT simulation and conformal treatment planning should be used with either 3D conformal radiation or intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). Proton beam therapya is appropriate in clinical settings where reduction in dose to organs at risk (eg, heart, lungs) is required that cannot be achieved by 3-D techniques, ideally within a clinical trial or registry study.1,2 • It is optimal to treat patients in the supine position as the setup is generally more stable and reproducible. • The patient should be instructed to avoid intake of a heavy meal 3 hours before simulation and treatment for lesions requiring therapy of the proximal stomach. • When clinically appropriate, IV and/or oral contrast for CT simulation may be used to aid in target localization. • Use of an immobilization device is strongly recommended for reproducibility of daily setup. • Respiratory motion may be significant for distal esophageal and EGJ lesions. When 4D-CT planning or other motion management techniques are used, margins may be modified to account for observed motion and may also be reduced if justified. The 4D-CT data may also be used to create an internal target volume (ITV) from which subsequent clinical target volume (CTV) and planning target volume (PTV) expansions can be made. • Target volumes need to be carefully defined and encompassed while designing IMRT plans. Uncertainties from variations in stomach filling and respiratory motion should be taken into account. For structures such as the lungs, attention should be given to the lung volume receiving low to moderate doses, as well as the volume receiving high doses. Attention should be paid to sparing the uninvolved stomach that may be used for future reconstruction (ie, anastomosis site).

a Data regarding proton beam therapy are early and evolving. Ideally, patients should be treated with proton beam therapy within a clinical trial.
Note: All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated. Clinical Trials: NCCN believes that the best management of any patient with cancer is in a clinical trial. Participation in clinical trials is especially encouraged.

NCCN Guidelines Index Table of Contents Discussion

PRINCIPLES OF RADIATION THERAPY Target Volume (General Guidelines): • Gross tumor volume (GTV) should include the primary tumor and involved regional lymph nodes as identified on the planning scan and
other pre-treatment diagnostic studies listed in the General Guidelines section above. • CTV may include the areas at risk for microscopic disease. CTV is defined as the primary tumor plus a 3- to 4-cm expansion superiorly and
inferiorly along the length of the esophagus and cardia and a 1-cm radial expansion.3 The nodal CTV should be defined by a 0.5- to 1.5-cm expansion from the nodal GTV. CTV should also include coverage of elective nodal regions such as the celiac axis; however, this decision would depend on the location of the primary tumor within the esophagus and EGJ. • PTV expansion should be 0.5 to 1 cm. The uncertainties arising from respiratory motion should also be taken into consideration. • Elective treatment of node-bearing regions depends on the location of the primary tumor in the esophagus and EGJ. Cervical esophagus: Consider treatment of the supraclavicular nodes and treatment of higher echelon cervical nodes, especially if the
nodal stage is N1 or greater. Proximal third of the esophagus: Consider treatment of para-esophageal lymph nodes and supraclavicular lymph nodes. Middle third of the esophagus: Consider treatment of para-esophageal lymph nodes. Distal third of esophagus and EGJ: Consider para-esophageal, lesser curvature, splenic nodes, and celiac axis nodal regions.

PRINCIPLES OF RADIATION THERAPY Normal Tissue Tolerance Dose-Limits4,5 • Treatment planning is essential to reduce unnecessary dose to organs at risk. • Lung dose may require particular attention, especially in the preoperatively treated patient. It is recognized that these dose guidelines may
be appropriately exceeded based on clinical circumstances.

Lungsb • V40Gy ≤10% • V30Gy ≤15% • V20Gy ≤20% • V10Gy ≤40% • V05Gy ≤50% • Mean <20 Gy

VM3e0Gayn≤<3235%Gy

Bowel • Max dose <54 Gy • V45Gy <195 cc Heart • V30Gy ≤30%
(closer to 20% preferred) • Mean <30 Gy
(closer to 26 Gy preferred)

Stomach • Mean <45 Gy • Max dose <54 Gy

b Lung dose-volume histogram (DVH) parameters as predictors of pulmonary complications in esophageal cancer patients treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy

should be strongly considered, though consensus on optimal criteria has not yet emerged. Every effort should be made to keep the lung volume and doses to a

minimum. Treating physicians should be aware that the DVH reduction algorithm is hardly the only risk factor for pulmonary complications. Important considerations

may also include plans for post-treatment surgery, pretreatment pulmonary function, and relevant comorbidities. DVH parameters as predictors of pulmonary

complications in esophageal cancer patients are an area of active development among the NCCN Member Institutions and others.

PRINCIPLES OF RADIATION THERAPY RT Dosing • Preoperative RT: 41.4–50.4 Gy (1.8–2.0 Gy/day) (total 23–28 fractions)c • Postoperative RT: 45–50.4 Gy (1.8–2.0 Gy/day) (total 25–28 fractions) • Definitive RT: 50–50.4 Gy (1.8–2.0 Gy/day)6 (total 25–28 fractions) Supportive Care • Treatment interruptions or dose reductions for manageable acute toxicities should be avoided. Careful patient monitoring and aggressive
supportive care are preferable to treatment interruptions. • During the radiation treatment course, patients should be seen for status check at least once a week with notation of vital signs, weight, and
blood counts. • Antiemetics should be given on a prophylactic basis when appropriate. Antacid, proton pump inhibitors, and antidiarrheal medications may
be prescribed when needed. • If estimated caloric intake is <1500 kcal/day, oral and/or enteral nutrition should be considered. When indicated, feeding jejunostomy
tubes (J-tubes) or nasogastric feeding tubes may be placed to ensure adequate caloric intake. During surgery, a J-tube may be placed for postoperative nutritional support. • Adequate enteral and/or IV hydration is necessary throughout chemoradiation and recovery.

c Patients who are at risk for not having surgery due to comorbidities or other risk factors should receive radiation doses of 50–50.4 Gy (1.8–2.0 Gy/day) because the

lower preoperative therapy dose may not be adequate.

For esophageal cancer, interventions undertaken to relieve major symptoms may result in significant prolongation of life. This appears to be particularly true when a multimodality interdisciplinary approach is pursued and, therefore, a multimodality interdisciplinary approach to palliative care of the esophageal cancer patient is encouraged.a Dysphagia • Assess the extent of disease and the functional degree of swallowing impairment, preferably through a standardized scoring scale and
confirm the etiology of dysphagia • Dysphagia grading scale8 Grade 0: Able to eat solid food without special attention to bite size or chewing Grade 1: Able to swallow solid food cut into pieces less than 18 mm in diameter and thoroughly chewed Grade 2: Able to swallow semisolid food (consistency of baby food) Grade 3: Able to swallow liquids only Grade 4: Unable to swallow liquids or saliva • Dysphagia arising from esophageal cancer most often is due to obstruction, but on occasion may be primarily due to tumor-related
dysmotility. • Patients with dysphagia who are not candidates for curative surgery should be considered for palliation of their dysphagia symptoms, based
on symptom severity. This can be achieved through multiple modalities, although placement of an esophageal stent is most commonly utilized. In contrast, stent placement is generally not advised in patients who may undergo curative surgery in the future due to concerns that stent-related adverse events may preclude curative surgery in the future.

a For patients who have immune-mediated toxicity, See NCCN Guidelines for Management of Immunotherapy-Related Toxicities.
Note: All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated. Clinical Trials: NCCN believes that the best management of any patient with cancer is in a clinical trial. Participation in clinical trials is especially encouraged.

PRINCIPLES OF PALLIATIVE/BEST SUPPORTIVE CARE1-7 Obstruction • Complete esophageal obstruction Endoscopic lumen restoration, generally performed via simultaneous retrograde (via a gastrostomy tract) and antegrade endoscopy Establish enteral access for purposes of hydration and nutrition if endoscopic lumen restoration is not undertaken or is unsuccessful.
◊ Surgical or radiologic placement of J-tube or gastrostomy tube External beam radiation therapy (EBRT) Brachytherapy may be considered in place of EBRT if a lumen can be restored that allows for the use of appropriate applicators.
Brachytherapy should only be performed by practitioners experienced with the delivery of esophageal brachytherapy. PDT can effectively treat esophageal obstruction, but is less commonly performed due to associated photosensitivity and costs.9 Chemotherapy Surgery may on occasion be useful in carefully selected patients. • Severe esophageal obstruction (able to swallow liquids only) Wire-guided dilation or balloon dilation (caution should be exercised when dilating malignant strictures as this may be associated with an
increased risk of perforation) Endoscopy or fluoroscopy-guided placement of partially or fully covered expandable metal stents.
◊ There are data suggesting a lower migration and stent occlusion rates with the larger diameter covered expandable metal stents, but an increased risk of other complications such as bleeding and esophago-respiratory fistula.10
◊ If possible, the distal end of the stent should remain above the EGJ to reduce symptoms of reflux and risk of aspiration. EBRT11 and brachytherapy both effectively treat malignant dysphagia.
◊ The onset of symptom relief for EBRT or brachytherapy is slower compared to endoscopic palliation but is also likely to be more durable.1,12
Other measures as stated above • Moderate esophageal obstruction (able to swallow semisolid food) Measures stated above may be considered, but should be balanced with the associated risks. Pain • If patient is experiencing tumor-related pain, then the pain should be assessed and treated in accordance with the NCCN Guidelines for Adult
Cancer Pain. Severe uncontrolled pain following esophageal stent placement should be treated with endoscopic removal of the stent once the
uncontrollable nature of the pain is established.

Note: All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated. Clinical Trials: NCCN believes that the best management of any patient with cancer is in a clinical trial. Participation in clinical trials is especially encouraged.

PRINCIPLES OF PALLIATIVE/BEST SUPPORTIVE CARE1-7 Bleeding • Acute bleeding from esophageal cancer may represent a pre-terminal event secondary to tumor-related aorto-esophageal fistualization.
Endoscopic assessment and intervention may lead to precipitous exsanguination, and therefore should be undertaken cautiously. If bleeding appears to be primarily from the tumor surface, then endoscopic electrocoagulation techniques such as bipolar
electrocoagulation or argon plasma coagulation may be useful for control of bleeding; however, limited data suggest that while endoscopic therapies may initially be effective, the rate of recurrent bleeding is very high.13 • Chronic blood loss from esophageal cancer EBRT Nausea/Vomiting • If the patient is experiencing nausea and vomiting, then he/she should be treated in accordance with the NCCN Guidelines for Antiemesis. • Nausea and vomiting may be associated with luminal obstruction, so endoscopic or fluoroscopic evaluation should be performed to determine if luminal enhancement is indicated.

PRINCIPLES OF SURVEILLANCE • The surveillance strategies after successful therapy for esophageal and EGJ cancers remain controversial, with no high-level evidence to
guide development of algorithms that balance benefits and risks (including cost) within this cohort. • The goal of this document is to provide guidance for stage-specific surveillance based on the currently available retrospectively analyzed
literature1-6 and the expertise of the panel members to individualize surveillance recommendations. It is hoped that prospective data will emerge and we will be able to propose surveillance recommendations based on the evidence. • It should be noted that although the majority (~90%) of relapses occur within the first 2 years after completion of local therapy, potentially actionable relapses have been recognized sometimes more than 5 years after local therapy. Metachronous malignancy (a second cancer in the residual esophagus or in the case of SCC in a different organ) is also a consideration in long-term survivors. • The recommendations outlined below are following completion of local therapy. p-Stage 0–I (Tis, T1a, and T1b) Differences in follow-up for early-stage esophageal cancer reflect a heterogeneous potential for relapse and overall survival.7-13 Whereas fully treated Tis and T1a, N0 disease have prognoses that approximate a non-cancer cohort, T1b disease does not perform as well. Thus, recommendations vary according to the depth of invasion and treatment modality. Evidence-based guidelines have not been established for all stages of completely treated early-stage esophageal cancer. The following suggestions are based on results from trials and current practice. Stage II or III (T2–T4,N0–N+,T4b) treated with bimodality therapy (definitive chemoradiation) Literature suggests that locoregional relapses are common after bimodality therapy.3 Therefore, EGD is a valuable surveillance tool in these patients. Most relapses (95%) occur within 24 months. Thus, surveillance for at least 24 months is recommended for these patients.3 Stage II or III (T2–T4,N0–N+,T4b) treated with trimodality therapy Literature suggests that local/regional relapses are uncommon; therefore, EGD surveillance is not recommended.1,2,4 The risk and rate of relapse have been correlated with surgical pathology (yp) stage. For example, patients withyp stage III have a much higher rate of relapse (and relapses occurring early during surveillance) than patients with yp stage 0 (relapses are not frequent in these patients). Literature also suggests that 90% of relapses occur within 36 months of surgery; therefore, surveillance for at least 36 months is recommended. See Table 1 (ESOPH-I 2 of 3) for specific surveillance recommendations.

Note: All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated. Clinical Trials: NCCN believes that the best management of any patient with cancer is in a clinical trial. Participation in clinical trials is especially encouraged.

Surveillance Recommendations

Tis or T1a with/ without BE

ER/ablation

• Once eradication of all neoplasia/high-risk preneoplasia has been achieved, endoscopic surveillance is
recommended.
• EGD should be performed every 3 months for the first year, then every 6 months for the second year, and then annually indefinitely.14
• Imaging studies as a surveillance tool are not recommended.

Tis, T1a, N0

Esophagectomy

Although the goal of the resection would be to resect all areas of Tis or T1a and Barrett esophagus (BE), patients with incompletely resected BE should undergo ablation and then endoscopic surveillance as above (Tis/T1a ER/ablation). Otherwise, EGD as needed based on symptoms. Imaging studies as a surveillance tool are not recommended.

ER/ablation

• Once eradication of all cancer/HGD has been achieved, endoscopic surveillance is recommended. • EGD every 3 months for the first year, every 4–6 months for the second year, then annually indefinitely.
EUS may be considered in conjunction with EGD. Further therapy will be determined if either BE, cancer, or malignant lymphadenopathy is diagnosed at surveillance. • Imaging (CT chest/abdomen with contrast unless contraindicated) may be considered every 6 months for the first 2 years and annually for up to 5 years.

T1b or greater, Any Na or T1a N+

PRINCIPLES OF SURVIVORSHIP Surveillance: See ESOPH-9, ESOPH-17, and Principles of Surveillance (ESOPH-I) • Surveillance should be performed in conjunction with good routine medical care, including routine health maintenance, preventive care, and
cancer screening. • In general, routine esophageal/EGJ cancer-specific surveillance is not recommended for more than 5 years following the end of treatment. • Annual history and physical exam is reasonable as potential second primary cancers (second cancer in residual esophagus or second
primary squamous cell cancer in a separate organ) are possible. Management of Long-Term Sequelae of Disease or Treatment • For common survivorship issues, see NCCN Guidelines for Survivorship • Esophageal/EGJ cancer-specific issues1-6: Gastrointestinal issues7-10:
◊ Malnutrition/malabsorption11-13: – Monitor weight regularly after esophagectomy to ensure stability, recognizing that progressive weight loss is expected in the first 6 months – Monitor for malnutrition, especially during initial 6 months after surgery14,15 ▪ Consider monitoring vitamin B, folic acid, vitamin D, and calcium levels – Consider referral to dietician or nutrition services for individualized counseling – Assess for and address contributing medical and/or psychosocial factors
◊ Delayed gastric emptying16: – Encourage small portions and more frequent eating (5 small meals/day) – Minimize high fat and fiber content in food – Consider referral to gastroenterology for refractory symptomsa
◊ Dumping syndrome: – Encourage frequent meals scheduled throughout day (5 small meals/day) – Consume a diet high in protein and fiber, and low in simple carbohydrates or concentrated sweets – Avoid fluid consumption with meals
◊ Reflux symptoms: – Avoid lying flat after eating – Use a foam wedge (triangular) pillow in bed and avoid full prone sleeping position at night – Consider proton pump inhibitors, although it is usually biliary reflux that exacerbates reflux symptoms
◊ Dysphagia: – Evaluate for anastomotic stricture

a Consider botulinum toxin injection of pylorus if emptying procedure was not performed at original surgery.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2023 Esophageal and Esophagogastric Junction Cancers

Overview
Upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract cancers originating in the esophagus or esophagogastric junction (EGJ) constitute a major global health problem.1 Globally, there were an estimated 604,000 new cases and more than 544,000 deaths in 2020, making esophageal cancer the seventh most frequently diagnosed cancer and the sixth leading cause of cancerrelated deaths in the world.2,3 The global incidence of esophageal and EGJ cancers shows wide geographic variation, with a 60-fold difference between high- and low-incidence regions.4 The highest-incidence area, often referred to as the “esophageal cancer belt,” spans from northern Iran through Central Asia and into Northern China.1,5 Other high-incidence areas include Southern and Eastern Africa and Northern France.6 In contrast, esophageal cancer is one of the least frequently diagnosed cancers in North America. It is the twentieth most frequently diagnosed cancer and the eleventh leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States.7 In 2023, an estimated 21,560 people are expected to be diagnosed and 16,120 people are expected to die of this disease in the United States.8 Although still relatively rare, incidence rates have been increasing in the United States over the past several years and the 5-year survival rate remains low.8
Esophageal cancers are histologically classified as squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) or adenocarcinoma, which differ in their etiology, pathology, tumor location, therapeutics, and prognosis.9 In contrast to esophageal adenocarcinoma, which usually affects the lower esophagus, esophageal SCC is more likely to localize at or higher than the tracheal bifurcation. SCC also has a proclivity for earlier lymphatic spread and is associated with a poorer prognosis.9,10 SCC is the most common histology in Eastern Europe and Asia, while adenocarcinoma is most common in North America and Western Europe. Tobacco and alcohol consumption are major risk factors for SCC, whereas tobacco use is a moderate risk factor for adenocarcinoma.11-13 The risk for SCC decreases substantially

after smoking cessation, whereas the risk for adenocarcinoma remains unchanged even several years after smoking cessation.14,15 SCC has become less common in North America and Western Europe in recent decades due to reduced tobacco and alcohol use, and now accounts for less than 30% of all esophageal cancers in the United States and Western Europe.1
In contrast, the incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma has increased in North America and Western Europe, likely reflecting rising rates of obesity.1 High body mass index (BMI) has been established as the strongest risk factor for adenocarcinoma of the esophagus.12,16,17 Obesity contributes to the development of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), a major underlying cause of esophageal adenocarcinoma.18-20 GERD is associated with the development of Barrett esophagus, a precancerous condition in which the normal squamous epithelium of the esophagus is replaced by a metaplastic, columnar, or glandular epithelium that is predisposed to malignancy.21 Patients with Barrett esophagus have a 30 to 60 times greater risk of developing adenocarcinoma of the esophagus than the general population.19 Older age, male gender assigned at birth, long-standing GERD, hiatal hernia size, and the length of Barrett esophagus are strongly associated with higher grades of dysplasia and increased risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma development.22-24
Literature Search Criteria and Guidelines Update Methodology
Prior to the update of this version of the NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®) Esophageal and Esophagogastric Junction Cancers, an electronic search of the PubMed database was performed to obtain key literature published since the last Guidelines update, using the following search terms: esophageal cancer, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, esophageal adenocarcinoma, EGJ cancer, and

gastroesophageal junction cancer. The PubMed database was chosen as it remains the most widely used resource for medical literature and indexes peer-reviewed biomedical literature.25
The search results were narrowed by selecting studies in humans published in English. Results were confined to the following article types: Clinical Trial, Phase II; Clinical Trial, Phase III; Clinical Trial, Phase IV; Guideline; Randomized Controlled Trial; Meta-Analysis; Systematic Reviews; and Validation Studies.
The data from key PubMed articles selected by the panel for review during the Guidelines update meeting as well as articles from additional sources deemed as relevant to these Guidelines and discussed by the panel have been included in this version of the Discussion section (eg, e-publications ahead of print, meeting abstracts). Recommendations for which high-level evidence is lacking are based on the panel’s review of lower-level evidence and expert opinion.
NCCN recommendations have been developed to be inclusive of individuals of all sexual and gender identities to the greatest extent possible. When citing published studies and recommendations from other organizations, the terms used (eg, male, female) reflect the cited sources.
The complete details of the Development and Update of the NCCN Guidelines are available at www.NCCN.org.
Hereditary Cancer Predisposition Syndromes Associated with an Increased Risk for Esophageal and EGJ Cancers
Although early age of onset and family history are associated with hereditary cancer, specific recommendations for esophageal and EGJ cancer risk assessment are not possible at this time due to limited data. Referral to a cancer genetics professional is recommended for individuals with a known high-risk syndrome associated with esophageal and EGJ

cancers. The most common hereditary cancer predisposition syndromes are discussed in detail below.
Tylosis
Tylosis (also known as focal non-epidermolytic palmoplantar keratoderma [PPK] or Howel-Evans syndrome) is a very rare autosomal dominant syndrome caused by germline mutations in the RHBDF2 gene.26 PPK is a complex group of hereditary syndromes characterized by abnormal skin thickening on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. PPK is classified as diffuse, punctate, or focal based on the patterns of skin thickening, and as epidermolytic or non-epidermolytic based on histology. The focal non-epidermolytic form of PPK (tylosis) is specifically associated with a higher lifetime risk of developing SCC of the middle and distal esophagus.27,28 In individuals with tylosis, the average age at diagnosis of esophageal SCC is 45 years. The risk of developing SCC of the esophagus has been reported to be 40% to 90% by age 70 years.29,30 Routine screening by upper GI endoscopy is recommended for patients with tylosis and their family members after age 20 years.27
Familial Barrett Esophagus
Barrett esophagus is a condition in which the normal squamous epithelium of the esophagus is replaced by a metaplastic, columnar, or glandular epithelium that is predisposed to the development of adenocarcinoma (see Barrett Esophagus below).21 The familial aggregation of Barrett esophagus and adenocarcinoma of the esophagus or EGJ is termed familial Barrett esophagus (FBE).31-33 Reviews of hospital case series indicate that between 5% and 7% of patients with Barrett esophagus and esophageal adenocarcinoma report a family history of either disease.34 In one cohort study, family history was identified as an independent predictor for the presence of Barrett esophagus and adenocarcinoma of the esophagus or EGJ, after adjusting for age, sex, and the presence of obesity 10 or more

years prior to study enrollment.32 A study by Chak et al identified Barrett esophagus in 21% of first-degree relatives of patients with Barrett esophagus or esophageal adenocarcinoma.35 Furthermore, Barrett esophagus was identified significantly more often in siblings and offspring of FBE probands than in probands with isolated cases of Barrett esophagus.
FBE may be associated with one or more autosomally inherited dominant susceptibility alleles.36 Reports have identified germline mutations in a variety of susceptibility genes that may be associated with the development of Barrett esophagus; however, none has been validated.37,38 Since development of Barrett esophagus is strongly associated with GERD, it is possible that GERD is inherited, with Barrett esophagus occurring as a consequence. However, since GERD is not always observed in patients with FBE, and there is an unusually high rate of progression to adenocarcinoma in families with FBE, additional genetic factors may be required for the development of FBE.34 A recent study using whole exome sequencing (WES) on four distant relatives from a multiplex, multigenerational family with FBE identified the uncharacterized gene VSIG10L as a candidate FBE susceptibility gene, with a putative role in maintaining normal esophageal homeostasis.39 However, future studies on the prevalence of VSIG10L mutations in this population are needed to allow for risk stratification of FBE susceptibility.
Potential family history of Barrett esophagus and adenocarcinoma of the esophagus or EGJ should be determined for patients presenting with GERD, especially white patients over 40 years who were assigned male gender at birth. Screening for Barrett esophagus by upper GI endoscopy is recommended in family members with FBE after age 40 years, especially if the individual has a history of GERD.

Bloom Syndrome
Bloom syndrome (BS) is a rare autosomal recessive syndrome belonging to a group of chromosomal breakage syndromes. BS is characterized by mutations in the BLM/RECQL3 gene at 15q26.1 and is associated with strikingly elevated sister chromatid exchange rates in all cells, resulting in an increased predisposition to a wide variety of malignancies.40 Acute myeloid leukemia (AML), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), lymphoid neoplasms, and Wilms tumor are the predominant cancers diagnosed before age 20 years, whereas carcinomas of many different organ sites including SCC of the esophagus are diagnosed after age 20 years.27,41 Individuals with BS are of ten diagnosed with cancers at an earlier age than the general population. The presence of chromosomal quadraradials with breakage may be used for the diagnosis of BS.27 Screening for GERD (with or without endoscopy to detect early esophageal cancer) after age 20 years may be considered.
Fanconi Anemia
Fanconi anemia (FA) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by congenital malformations, progressive pancytopenia, and an increased predisposition to the development of hematologic malignancies and solid tumors.27 FA is caused by mutations in one of 15 genes encoding the FA pathway, with FANCA, FANCC, FANCG, and FANCD2 being the most common.42 AML is the most common cancer occurring in patients with FA; however, patients with FA are also at an increased risk of developing SCC of the head, neck, and esophagus.27,43,44 Individuals with FA are identified by pancytopenia, chromosomal breakage, and hematologic abnormalities, including anemia, bleeding, and easy bruising. Karyotyping does not identify individuals with FA, but enhanced chromosomal breakage with mitomycin C can identify homozygotes.27,45 Endoscopy of the esophagus may be considered as a screening strategy in individuals with FA.

Staging
The tumor (T), node (N), and metastasis (M) staging system used by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) is the internationally accepted standard for cancer staging and is a major factor influencing prognosis and treatment decisions. Staging recommendations for esophageal and EGJ cancers presented in the Eighth Edition of the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual include clinical staging (cTNM; newly diagnosed, not-yet-treated patients), pathologic staging (pTNM; patients undergoing resection without prior treatment), and post neoadjuvant pathologic staging (ypTNM; patients receiving preoperative therapy).10 The Eighth Edition also introduced modifications regarding tumors located at the EGJ. Using this system, tumors with an epicenter located greater than 2 cm into the proximal stomach are now staged as gastric carcinomas, even if the EGJ is involved. Tumors involving the EGJ with an epicenter less than or equal to 2 cm into the proximal stomach will still be staged as esophageal carcinomas.
The Eighth Edition of the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual provides additional resources for esophageal and EGJ cancers not available in the Seventh Edition, including the incorporation of newly constructed cTNM and ypTNM stage groupings, to fulfill unmet needs in staging patients under different circumstances. The stage groupings presented in the Eighth Edition are based on updated data with a significantly increased sample size and number of risk adjustment variables. The current stage groupings were determined using a risk-adjusted random survival forest analysis of collated data generated by the Worldwide Esophageal Cancer Collaboration (WECC) for 22,654 patients spanning six continents who were treated with esophagectomy alone or esophagectomy with preoperative and/or postoperative therapy.10 Use of these data reflects the current preference for treating locally advanced esophageal cancers with preoperative therapy and represents a major advancement over the seventh edition, which was entirely based on data

from patients treated with esophagectomy alone. The availability of these data led to the ability to explicitly define cTNM and ypTNM cohorts and stages. The larger dataset also allowed for better separation of SCC and adenocarcinoma staging.10 However, limitations of this dataset still remain, including missing patient variables, heterogeneity of clinical staging among different centers, and poor representation of patients who are untreatable or inoperable, such as those with T4b and M1 cancers. Additionally, the exact modalities used to arrive at the initial clinical stages were not available for analysis. Nevertheless, the Eighth Edition of the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual represents the best worldwide clinical esophageal cancer staging data currently available. Survival analysis of this data set revealed that survival decreased with increasing anatomic tumor size and depth (pT), presence of regional lymph node metastases (pN), presence of distant metastases (pM), increasing histologic grade (G1–4), and advancing age.46,47 Survival increased with a more distal location of cancer within the esophagus. In addition, survival was significantly affected by histopathologic type, with SCC having worse survival than adenocarcinoma.47 Analysis of this larger dataset also illuminated significant differences in outcome when comparing the same stage groups between patients receiving preoperative therapy versus those treated with surgery alone, emphasizing the importance of having separate pTNM and ypTNM stage groupings to stage patients more accurately within each treatment algorithm.
In esophageal cancer, patient survival is best correlated with the final pathologic stage, regardless of whether the patient has received preoperative therapy.10 Although surgical pathology yields the most accurate staging, advances in endoscopic techniques and imaging modalities such as endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), CT, and 18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET/CT have greatly improved the accuracy of clinical staging.48 In general, initial staging of locoregional

disease is usually best done with a combination of CT and EUS, while staging of possible distant metastatic disease is best assessed with FDG-PET/CT.49 Locoregional staging with preoperative EUS provides the most accuracy for cT staging and is the only method capable of delineating the layers of the esophageal wall.50 In a meta-analysis of 49 studies, EUS provided good sensitivity and specificity for accurately cT staging advanced-stage disease.51 However, EUS has shown poor accuracy for distinguishing between early-stage tumors limited to the mucosa (cT1a) from those extending into the submucosa (cT1b).51-54 Therefore, endoscopic resection (ER), which is essential for the accurate staging of early-stage cancers, should be performed for early-stage tumors (cT1a and cT1b ≤2 cm) as it provides more accurate information on the depth of tumor invasion than EUS.55,56 Ultimately, a cancer that is completely removed by ER should be assigned pathologic staging.10
CT of the chest and abdomen with oral and IV contrast or FDG-PET/CT from skull base to mid-thigh can be used to determine the location of the primary tumor and its proximity to other structures. Although FDGPET/CT has higher sensitivity for detecting esophageal cancer than CT alone, it has a limited role in cT staging other than for determining invasion of the mediastinum.57 The diagnostic benefit of FDG-PET/CT is particularly limited in early-stage (cT1) tumors because of the low prevalence of distant metastases and the high rate of false-positive FDGPET/CT findings.58,59 FDG-PET/CT also has limited ability to differentiate between cT1, cT2, and cT3 tumors.10,49 Although the intensity of FDG uptake and cT category are positively related, this association is weak.58,60,61 Therefore, chest/abdominal CT scan should be performed with oral and IV contrast in all patients as part of the initial workup (as well as pelvic CT scan with contrast if clinically indicated) while FDGPET/CT should be reserved for patients with no evidence of M1 disease.
While CT and FDG-PET/CT may be used to describe the locoregional lymph nodes (cN), these techniques are suboptimal for detecting

locoregional nodal metastasis because of their low sensitivity.50,60,62-65 CT has a pooled sensitivity of 30% to 60% for detecting enlarged nodes greater than 1 cm.48 FDG-PET/CT also has a low pooled sensitivity (~51%) in locoregional nodal assessment since these nodes are often obscured by the metabolic activity in the primary tumor.66 In contrast, EUS has high sensitivity (~85%) for assessing the degree of nodal involvement.51 Furthermore, the addition of fine-needle aspiration (FNA) to EUS (EUS-FNA) has shown greater sensitivity and accuracy than either EUS alone or CT scan in the evaluation of cN staging, especially in assessing locoregional and celiac lymph nodes.51,67-69 In a study that compared the performance characteristics of EUS and EUS-FNA for preoperative cN staging in 74 patients with esophageal cancer, EUS-FNA was more sensitive (93% vs. 63%; P = .01) and accurate (93% vs. 70%; P = .02) when compared to EUS alone.68 In another study that compared the performance characteristics of CT, EUS, and EUS-FNA for preoperative cN staging in 125 patients with esophageal cancer, EUS-FNA was more sensitive than CT (83% vs. 29%; P < .001) and more accurate than CT (87% vs. 51%; P < .001) or EUS alone (87% vs. 74%; P = .012).69 Additionally, a retrospective review of 148 patients with esophageal cancer who underwent nodal staging with EUS-FNA and FDG-PET found that the addition of FDG-PET did not alter nodal staging in any patient with complete EUS-FNA, suggesting a limited role for FDG-PET alone in detecting locoregional metastatic nodes.70
While contrast-enhanced CT is the most widely used modality for detecting distant metastases in esophageal cancer, FDG-PET/CT is more sensitive than CT alone for staging cM disease.10,49,60,62,71 The addition of FDG-PET improves the detection of distant metastases that may remain occult on CT scan of the chest and abdomen, thereby allowing proper patient selection for surgical resection.10,49 In a prospective multicenter trial of 129 patients with esophageal cancer without definite distant metastases, PET identified metastatic sites in

41% of cases and altered management in 38% of cases.72 However, potential pitfalls of FDG-PET/CT include the poor detection of hepatic metastases when the CT component is performed without IV contrast and the high rate of false-positive FDG-PET findings.58,59,64,65
In North America, where screening programs for early detection of esophageal and EGJ cancers are not in use or practical because of low incidence, diagnosis is often made late in the disease course. At diagnosis, nearly 50% of patients have cancer that extends beyond the locoregional confines of the primary tumor. Fewer than 60% of patients with locoregional cancers can undergo a curative resection. Approximately 70% to 80% of resected specimens harbor metastases in the regional lymph nodes. Thus, patients in North America often have advanced-stage disease at the time of initial diagnosis, which is reflected by the low survival rates seen with esophageal and EGJ cancers in this region.
Siewert Classification of EGJ Adenocarcinoma
In 1996, Siewert et al classified EGJ adenocarcinoma into three types based purely on the anatomic location of the epicenter of the tumor or the majority of the tumor mass.73 In 2000, this classification was slightly changed.74 Siewert Type I tumors are now defined as an adenocarcinoma of the lower esophagus with the tumor epicenter located within 1 to 5 cm above the anatomic EGJ. Siewert Type II tumors are defined as a true carcinoma of the cardia with the tumor epicenter located within 1 cm above and 2 cm below the EGJ. Siewert Type III tumors are defined as a subcardial carcinoma with the tumor epicenter located between 2 to 5 cm below the EGJ, which infiltrates the EGJ and the lower esophagus from below.
In the Eighth Edition of the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual, EGJ tumors with epicenters located within 2 cm of the proximal stomach (Siewert Types I and II) are staged as esophageal adenocarcinoma.10 EGJ tumors

with epicenters located greater than 2 cm into the stomach (Siewert Type III) are now staged using the gastric cancer staging system. In general, Siewert Types I and II tumors should be managed in accordance with the NCCN Guidelines for Esophageal and Esophagogastric Cancers, while Siewert Type III tumors are more appropriately managed in accordance with the NCCN Guidelines for Gastric Cancer. Therapeutic decisions may be refined according to the location of the individual tumor, nodal distribution, and specific requirements for local control. However, the management approach for Siewert Type III tumors remains a subject of disagreement and debate. An individualized therapeutic approach may be preferred for specific patients and tumor locations, based on thorough pretreatment staging.
Barrett Esophagus
Barrett esophagus is a condition in which the normal squamous epithelium of the esophagus is replaced by a metaplastic, columnar, or glandular epithelium that is predisposed to the development of dysplasia.21 Barrett esophagus can progress to low-grade dysplasia (LGD), high-grade dysplasia (HGD), and in some cases to adenocarcinoma of the esophagus.19 In a large case-controlled study, severe and frequent GERD symptoms, nocturnal GERD symptoms, and a family history of GERD were the factors most strongly associated with an increased risk of developing Barrett esophagus in the general population.75 A recent systematic review and meta-analysis also identified obesity, family history of Barrett esophagus, and male gender assigned at birth as risk factors for the development of Barrett esophagus.76 Patients with Barrett esophagus are at a greater risk of developing adenocarcinoma of the esophagus than the general population. Older age, male gender assigned at birth, long-standing GERD, hiatal hernia size, and the length of Barrett esophagus are strongly associated with the progression of Barrett esophagus to

adenocarcinoma.20,22-24,77-79 Additionally, biomarkers such as aneuploidy Treatment

and loss of heterozygosity of p53 have also been associated with an increased risk of progression of Barrett esophagus to HGD and/or adenocarcinoma.77 However, these biomarkers require further prospective evaluation as predictors of risk for the development of HGD and adenocarcinoma of the esophagus in patients with Barrett esophagus.

ER, either by endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) or endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD), followed by radiofrequency ablation (RFA) has become the standard treatment for most patients with Barrett esophagus and HGD. Alternative strategies include cryoablation or photodynamic therapy (PDT).85-87 Surgical resection is reserved for patients with HGD and characteristics that are unfavorable for

Diagnosis
Endoscopy should be performed on patients with severe symptoms of GERD, especially those with a family history of Barrett esophagus or esophageal cancer. Multiple biopsies (6–8) using larger size endoscopy forceps should be performed to provide sufficient material for histologic and molecular interpretation.80 The location, length, and circumferential extent of Barrett esophagus should be characterized in accordance with the Prague classification and mucosal nodules should be carefully documented.81 For patients with metaplasia or LGD, GERD can be controlled with histamine receptor antagonists or proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). The use of wide-area transepithelial sampling with computerassisted 3-dimensional analysis (WATS3D), a relatively new sampling technique combining an abrasive brush biopsy of the Barrett esophagus mucosa with computer-assisted pathology analysis to highlight abnormal cells, may help increase the detection of esophageal dysplasia in patients with Barrett esophagus. In a multicenter prospective trial, patients with Barrett esophagus (n = 160) were randomized to receive biopsy sampling in conjunction with WATS or biopsy sampling alone. Results showed that the addition of WATS to biopsy sampling was feasible and yielded an additional 23 cases of HGD/esophageal adenocarcinoma (absolute increase, 14.4%).82 Two other studies have reported similar results.83,84 However, the utility and accuracy of WATS for detecting HGD/adenocarcinoma in patients with Barrett esophagus

non-surgical therapy, such as nodularity or long-segment involvement. Initial concerns regarding the use of ESD for Barrett esophagus involved the perceived increased risk of complications, including stricture formation, associated with deep submucosal dissection. However, a recent retrospective analysis found no increase in complication rates with the use of ESD compared to EMR followed by RFA.88 Additionally, a meta-analysis by Yang et al found that ESD for the management of early Barrett esophagus was associated with a high en-bloc resection rate, acceptable safety profile, and low recurrence rate after curative resection. These data suggest that ESD is safe and highly effective for the management of Barrett esophagus neoplasia.89
Based on randomized trials, RFA alone may also be useful for patients with Barrett esophagus with confirmed LGD or HGD.90-93 In a multicenter randomized clinical trial that enrolled 136 patients with Barrett esophagus and LGD, RFA was found to be safe and effectively eradicated LGD and reduced the rate of progression from LGD to HGD and adenocarcinoma over 3 years of follow-up.92 A study reporting the long-term outcome of this trial confirmed that RFA of Barrett esophagus with LGD significantly reduced the risk of malignant progression after a median follow-up of 73 months.94 In a multicenter randomized trial involving patients with HGD, complete eradication occurred in 81% of those in the RFA group compared to 19% of those in the control group (P < .001).90

Surveillance
Some studies suggest that the rate of progression of Barrett esophagus to adenocarcinoma of the esophagus is much lower than previously reported.95,96 However, recent data have demonstrated an increased prevalence of HGD and adenocarcinoma on index endoscopy in patients with Barrett esophagus over the past 25 years.97 Endoscopic surveillance with multiple biopsies (6–8) should be performed to evaluate the progression of Barrett esophagus from metaplasia to LGD, HGD, or adenocarcinoma. Larger forceps are recommended during surveillance endoscopy of Barrett esophagus for the detection of dysplasia.80
The current clinical guidelines from the American College of Gastroenterology recommend endoscopic surveillance in patients with Barrett esophagus at intervals determined by the presence and grade of dysplasia.91 Given the low risk of progression of Barrett esophagus to esophageal adenocarcinoma, endoscopic surveillance at 3- to 5-year intervals is reasonable for patients without dysplasia. The presence of dysplasia of any grade should be confirmed by a second pathologist with expertise in GI pathology. Patients with confirmed LGD should receive endoscopic therapy. If endoscopic therapy is not performed, annual surveillance is recommended until two consecutive examinations are negative for dysplasia, after which time surveillance intervals for nondysplastic Barrett esophagus can be followed (every 3–5 years). If HGD is confirmed, patients should be managed with endoscopic therapy unless they have life-limiting comorbidity. Typically, endoscopic surveillance should use four-quadrant biopsies at 2-cm intervals in patients without dysplasia and 1-cm intervals in patients with prior dysplasia. For patients with results indefinite for dysplasia, endoscopy should be repeated after treatment for 3 to 6 months with acidsuppressive medications. If the “indefinite for dysplasia” reading is confirmed on this examination, a surveillance interval of 12 months is recommended. A retrospective study found that Barrett esophagus

indefinite for dysplasia was associated with a similar risk of progression to adenocarcinoma as Barrett esophagus with LGD.98 A recent systematic review and meta-analysis reached the same conclusion.99 Therefore, surveillance for these patients should follow the recommendations for LGD.
Pathologic Review and Biomarker Testing
Pathologic review and biomarker testing play important roles in the diagnosis, classification, and molecular characterization of esophageal and EGJ cancers. Classification based on histologic subtype and molecular features helps to improve early diagnosis and has implications for therapy. An accumulation of genetic aberrations occurs during esophageal carcinogenesis, including overexpression of growth factors and/or receptors, alterations in DNA damage response, and loss of genomic stability. Characterization of these pathways has enabled the application of molecular pathology to aid in the management of esophageal and EGJ cancers.
Principles of Pathologic Review
A specific diagnosis of esophageal SCC or adenocarcinoma should be established for staging and treatment purposes. Mixed adenosquamous carcinomas and carcinomas not otherwise specified are staged using the TNM staging system for SCC.10 In addition to the histologic type, the pathology report (regardless of the specimen type) should include specifics about tumor invasion and pathologic grade, which are required for staging. The pathology report of a biopsy or endoscopic mucosal resection specimen should also document the presence or absence of Barrett esophagus. Biopsies showing Barrett esophagus with suspected dysplasia should be reviewed by a second expert GI pathologist for confirmation.91 Barrett esophagus with HGD is reported as intraepithelial neoplasia (dysplasia) (Tis) for staging purposes.10

concluded that FDG-PET is predictive of pathologic response and survival in patients with esophageal cancer who undergo preoperative treatment.
The prognostic significance of FDG-PET has also been evaluated in prospective studies.124-129 However, many of these prospective studies are limited by their small sample size, with the exception of the MUNICON II trial, which included 110 patients with locally advanced adenocarcinoma of the EGJ.125 In this study, metabolic responders were defined as those with a decrease of greater than or equal to 35% in SUV following preoperative therapy. After a median follow-up of 2.3 years, median OS was not reached in metabolic responders, whereas the median OS was 25.8 months in non-responders (P = .015). Median event-free survival (EFS) was 29.7 months and 14 months, respectively, for metabolic responders and non-responders (P = .002). Major histologic remissions (<10% of residual cancer) were noted in 58% of metabolic responders but in 0% of non-responders. This study prospectively demonstrated that metabolic response as measured by FDG-PET is predictive of pathologic response and survival in patients with gastroesophageal carcinoma following preoperative therapy. Additional studies have reported similar outcomes.138-140
Although adding induction chemotherapy to chemoradiation and surgery has not been shown to improve survival over chemoradiation and surgery alone, response on FDG-PET scan to induction chemotherapy was shown in the MUNICON-1 trial to be a biomarker of benefit from chemotherapy.125 FDG-PET non-responders in this trial had chemotherapy terminated and were referred for earlier surgery as they do not clearly benefit from therapy continuation. MUNICON-2 indicated that FDG-PET non-responders to induction chemotherapy did not benefit from the subsequent addition of RT to chemotherapy prior to surgery.141 The CALGB 80803 trial used FDG-PET scan response to induction chemotherapy to direct either continuation of the same chemotherapy

regimen during chemoradiation (infusional fluorouracil/oxaliplatin or carboplatin/paclitaxel) in FDG-PET responders, or to cross over to an alternative regimen during chemoradiation in FDG-PET non-responders. 142,143 The primary endpoint, to enhance pCR rate at surgery in FDG-PET non-responders who changed chemotherapy during radiation, was met, indicating the potential for FDG-PET scan to direct selection of chemotherapy during chemoradiation after induction chemotherapy. The most promising results of this trial were in patients who were FDG-PET responders receiving mFOLFOX followed by infusional fluorouracil/oxaliplatin/radiation and surgery, providing additional support for the use of fluorouracil/oxaliplatin combined with RT as preoperative treatment. This strategy needs to be further developed before adoption into clinical practice.
In contrast, other studies have reported that FDG-PET has a limited utility for assessing response to preoperative therapy in patients with esophageal cancer, except for the detection of distant metastases.130137,144,145 However, FDG-PET was performed either during preoperative therapy or soon after the completion of preoperative therapy in many of these studies, which may reflect an inflammatory effect of radiation that obscures tumor-specific metabolic changes.135,146 RT and chemoradiation often cause local inflammatory reactions in the esophagus. Uptake of FDG in these inflammatory lesions occurs commonly, resulting in false-positive results on PET scan. Therefore, increased FDG uptake due to radiation-induced inflammation limits the use of FDG-PET for early response assessment of esophageal carcinomas.146 To reduce the incidence of false-positive results due to inflammation, the guidelines recommend that FDG-PET/CT (preferred) or FDG-PET should be performed at least 5 to 8 weeks after the completion of preoperative therapy. However, the guidelines caution that posttreatment FDG-PET results should not be used to select patients for

Principles of Biomarker Testing
Presently, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and/or molecular testing for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)/ERBB2 status, microsatellite instability (MSI) or mismatch repair (MMR) status, programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression, tumor mutational burden-high (TMB-H) status, neurotrophic tropomyosin-related kinase (NTRK) gene fusions, rearranged during transfection (RET) gene fusions and BRAF V600E mutations are utilized in the clinical management of advanced esophageal and EGJ cancers. When limited tissue is available for testing or the patient is unable to undergo a traditional biopsy, comprehensive genomic profiling via a validated next-generation sequencing (NGS) assay performed in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-approved environment may be used for the identification of ERBB2 amplification, MSI status, MMR deficiency, TMB, NTRK gene fusions, RET gene fusions and BRAF V600E mutations. The use of IHC, in situ hybridization (ISH), or targeted polymerase chain reaction (PCR) should be considered first, followed by NGS testing as appropriate. The biomarker panel is expected to enlarge as more subgroups are identified.

treatment option for patients with HER2 overexpression positive disease.
The reported rates of HER2 positivity in esophageal and EGJ cancers vary widely (2%–45%)148 and are more frequently seen in adenocarcinoma of the esophagus (15%–30%) than in SCC (5%–13%).150-153 Additionally, HER2 positivity has been reported to be higher in patients with EGJ adenocarcinomas than in patients with gastric adenocarcinomas.154-156 The HER-EAGLE study, which examined the HER2 positivity rate in a large multinational population of nearly 5000 patients with gastric or EGJ adenocarcinoma, reported that 14.2% of samples were HER2 overexpression positive.157 HER2 positivity was signif icantly higher in EGJ tumors versus stomach tumors and in intestinal subtypes versus diffuse subtypes. In the ToGA trial, HER2-positivity rates were 33% and 21%, respectively, for patients with EGJ and gastric cancers.158 Therefore, classification of gastroesophageal cancers based on histologic subtype and primary tumor location may have implications for therapy.
HER2 testing is recommended for patients with esophageal or EGJ adenocarcinoma at the time of diagnosis if metastatic adenocarcinoma is documented or suspected. In concordance with HER2 testing guidelines from CAP, the American Society for Clinical Pathology (ASCP), and the American Society for Clinical Oncology (ASCO),159 the NCCN Guidelines

Assessment of HER2 Overexpression
Overexpression of the HER2 protein or amplification of the ERBB2 gene has been implicated in the development of esophageal and EGJ cancers.147 However, unlike in breast cancer, the prognostic significance of HER2 status in esophageal and EGJ cancer is unclear. Some studies have reported that HER2 positivity is correlated with tumor invasion and lymph node metastasis, and thus indicates a poor prognosis.148,149 HER2

recommend using IHC and, if needed, ISH techniques to assess HER2 status in esophageal and EGJ cancers. NGS can be considered instead of sequential testing for single biomarkers when limited diagnostic tissue is available or when the patient is unable to undergo a traditional biopsy. The use of IHC/ISH should be considered first, followed by NGS testing as appropriate. Repeat biomarker testing may be considered at clinical or radiologic progression of metastatic adenocarcinoma.

immunoreactive tumor cells, with scores ranging from 0 (negative) to 3+ (positive). In 2008, Hofmann et al refined this 4-tiered scoring system to assess HER2 status in gastric cancer by using a cut-off of greater than or equal to 10% immunoreactive tumor cells in resection specimens.156,160 It should be noted that when scoring a biopsy specimen, a cluster with 5% immunoreactive tumor cells is sufficient for scoring. In a subsequent validation study (n = 447, prospective diagnostic gastric cancer specimens), this scoring system was found to be reproducible between different pathologists.161 This modified HER2 scoring system is therefore recommended by the panel. A score of 0 (membranous reactivity in <10% of cancer cells) or 1+ (faint membranous reactivity in ≥10% of cancer cells) is considered to be HER2-negative. A score of 2+ (weak to moderate membranous reactivity in ≥10% of cancer cells) is considered equivocal and should be additionally examined by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or other ISH methods. FISH/ISH results are expressed as the ratio between the number of copies of the ERBB2 gene and the number of chromosome 17 centromeres (CEP17) within the nucleus counted in at least 20 cancer cells (ERBB2:CEP17). Alternatively, FISH/ISH results may be given as the average ERBB2 copy number per cell. Cases that have an IHC score of 3+ (strong membranous reactivity in ≥10% of cancer cells) or an IHC score of 2+ and are FISH/ISH positive (ERBB2:CEP17 ratio ≥2 or average ERBB2 copy number ≥6 signals/cell) are considered HER2 positive. Positive (3+) or negative (0 or 1+) HER2 IHC results do not require further ISH testing. See Principles of Pathologic Review and Biomarker Testing: Assessment of Overexpression or Amplification of HER2 in Esophageal and Esophagogastric Junction Cancers - Table 3 in the algorithm for more inf ormation.

MSI and MMR Testing
Testing for MSI by PCR/NGS or MMR by IHC should be considered on locally advanced, recurrent, or metastatic esophageal and EGJ cancers in patients who are candidates for treatment with programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) inhibitors.162 MSI status is assessed by PCR or NGS to measure gene expression levels of microsatellite markers (ie, BAT25, BAT26, MONO27, NR21, NR24).163 MMR deficiency is evaluated by IHC to assess nuclear expression of proteins involved in DNA mismatch repair (ie, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2).164 PCR/NGS for MSI and IHC for MMR proteins measure different biological effects caused by deficient MMR function. Testing is performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue and results are interpreted in accordance with CAP DNA Mismatch Repair Biomarker Reporting Guidelines.165 Testing may be performed only in CLIA-approved laboratories. Patients with microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or deficient mismatch repair (dMMR) tumors should be referred to a genetics counselor for further assessment in the appropriate clinical context.
PD-L1 Testing
PD-L1 testing may be considered on locally advanced, recurrent, or metastatic esophageal and EGJ cancers in patients who are candidates for treatment with PD-1 inhibitors. A companion diagnostic test should be used to identif y patients f or treatment with PD-1 inhibitors. The companion diagnostic test is a qualitative IHC assay using anti-PD-L1 antibodies for the detection of PD-L1 protein levels in FFPE tumor tissue. A minimum of 100 tumor cells must be present in the PD-L1-stained slide for the specimen to be adequately evaluated. Combined positive score (CPS) is determined by the number of PD-L1–stained cells (ie, tumor cells, lymphocytes, macrophages) divided by the total number of viable tumor cells evaluated, multiplied by 100. A specimen is considered to have PDL1 expression if the CPS is greater than or equal to 1. PD-L1 testing

cancers.

Liquid Biopsy
The genomic alterations of solid cancers may be identified by evaluating circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in the blood, hence a form of liquid biopsy.149,166 Liquid biopsy is being used in patients who are unable to have a clinical biopsy for disease surveillance and management. The detection of mutations/alterations in DNA shed from esophageal and EGJ carcinomas can identify targetable alterations or the evolution of clones with altered treatment response profiles. In a study that analyzed the genomic alterations of 55 patients with advanced gastroesophageal adenocarcinomas using NGS performed on plasma-derived ctDNA, 69% of patients had one or more characterized alterations theoretically targetable by an FDA-approved agent (on- or off-label).149 Therefore, for patients who have advanced or metastatic esophageal/EGJ cancers and who may be unable to undergo a traditional biopsy or for disease progression monitoring, testing using a validated NGS-based comprehensive genomic profiling assay performed in a CLIA-approved laboratory may be considered. A negative result should be interpreted with caution, as this does not exclude the presence of tumor mutations or amplif ications.
Surgery
Surgery is a major component of treatment for locoregional esophageal and EGJ cancers. Improvements in staging techniques, patient selection, post-surgical care, and surgical experience have led to a marked reduction in surgical morbidity and mortality in recent years. Additionally, randomized trials have shown that preoperative chemoradiation167 and perioperative chemotherapy168 have significantly improved survival in

Principles of Surgery
All patients should be evaluated to determine whether they are medically fit enough to tolerate general anesthesia and major abdominal and/or thoracic surgery.169 Prior to surgery, clinical staging should be performed to assess resectability with CT scan of the chest and abdomen, wholebody FDG-PET (integrated FDG-PET/CT scan is preferred), and EUS.49 Esophagectomy should be considered for all patients with resectable esophageal cancer (>5 cm from cricopharyngeus) who are medically fit. Cervical or cervicothoracic esophageal cancers less than 5 cm from the cricopharyngeus should be treated with def initive chemoradiation. Enteral nutritional support should be considered for patients with significant dysphagia and/or weight loss prior to or during induction therapy. A jejunostomy f eeding tube is preferred over a gastrostomy f eeding tube f or preoperative nutritional support since placement of a gastrostomy tube may compromise the integrity of gastric conduit for reconstruction. In certain patients, careful Savary dilation may be adequate.
The Siewert tumor type should be assessed in all patients with adenocarcinomas involving the EGJ. The surgical approaches for Siewert Type I and II tumors are similar to those described above. Siewert Type III tumors are considered gastric cancers and the surgical approach for these tumors is described in the NCCN Guidelines for Gastric Cancer.73,170,171 In some cases, additional esophageal resection may be necessary to obtain adequate surgical margins. Laparoscopy may be useful in select patients for the detection of radiographically occult metastatic disease, especially in patients with Siewert Type II and III tumors.172 Positive peritoneal cytology in the absence of visible peritoneal metastases is associated with poor prognosis in patients with EGJ adenocarcinoma.173 Patients with advanced

tumors or node-positive tumors should be considered for laparoscopic staging with peritoneal washings.
Lymph node dissection (lymphadenectomy) can be performed using the standard or extended (en-bloc) technique. The number of lymph nodes removed has been shown to be an independent predictor of survival after esophagectomy.174,175 In a retrospective analysis of 4882 patients in the SEER database, patients diagnosed with invasive esophageal cancer who had 12 or more lymph nodes examined had significantly reduced mortality compared to those who had 0 to 11 lymph nodes examined; patients who had 30 or more lymph nodes examined had the lowest mortality of any group.176 A report from the WECC database, which analyzed 4627 patients who had esophagectomy without preoperative therapy, suggested that a greater extent of lymphadenectomy was associated with increased survival for all patients with node-positive cancers.175 Based on this study, optimum lymphadenectomy in node-positive cancers was 10 nodes for pT1, 15 nodes for pT2, and 29 to 50 nodes for pT3/T4. Therefore, the NCCN Guidelines® for Esophageal and Esophagogastric Junction Cancers recommend that a thorough dissection be performed to identify all lymph nodes with at least 15 lymph nodes submitted for pathologic evaluation and adequate nodal staging in patients undergoing esophagectomy without preoperative chemoradiation. The optimum number of nodes to be removed and examined after preoperative chemoradiation is unknown, although a recent study by Guo et al showed that resection of 13 to 29 nodes was associated with improved progression-free survival (PFS) and OS in patients with locally advanced esophageal SCC receiving preoperative chemoradiation.177 However, it is important to note that extensive lymphadenectomy (>29 nodes) did not seem to be correlated with increased survival in these patients.177,178 A recently published meta-analysis demonstrated a survival benefit for an increased lymph node yield from esophagectomy regardless of whether or not patients had received preoperative therapy.179 Therefore, the NCCN

Guidelines for Esophageal and Esophagogastric Junction Cancers also recommended resection of at least 15 lymph nodes for patients with esophageal cancer who received preoperative therapy.
Patients with Tis or T1a tumors may be treated with endoscopic therapies (see below). Patients with positive deep margins after ER or with tumors invading into the submucosa (T1b) or deeper may be treated with esophagectomy. Patients with T1–T3 tumors are considered to be potentially resectable, even in the presence of regional nodal metastases, although patients with bulky tumors and/or multi-station nodal involvement have poor OS. T4a tumors with involvement of the pericardium, pleura, or diaphragm may be resectable; however, T4a tumors with distant metastases including non-regional lymph node involvement, EGJ tumors with supraclavicular lymph node involvement, and T4b tumors with involvement of the heart, great vessels, trachea, or adjacent organs including liver, pancreas, lung, and spleen are considered unresectable.
Surgery is usually performed with curative intent but may be included as a component of palliative care for dysphagia or fistula. Palliative resections, however, should be avoided when possible in patients with clearly unresectable or advanced cancer with comorbidities, including severe cardiac or pulmonary disease. These patients may benefit from noninvasive palliative interventions. Palliative esophagectomy can also be considered for patients with cervical esophageal cancer who develop localized resectable recurrence or untreatable stricture after definitive chemoradiation if there is no distant recurrence.180
Surgical Approaches
The type of esophageal resection is dictated by the tumor location as well as the available choices for conduit. Several operative techniques are acceptable for esophagectomy in patients with resectable esophageal or EGJ cancers.181 The two most common surgical approaches are Ivor Lewis and McKeown transthoracic esophagectomy. Transhiatal

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2023 Esophageal and Esophagogastric Junction Cancers

esophagectomy and left transthoracic or thoracoabdominal esophagectomy are other recommended techniques; however, transhiatal esophagectomy should not be used as a routine approach. These techniques are described in detail below. The panel emphasizes that esophagectomy should always be performed in high-volume centers by experienced surgeons.182
Ivor Lewis and McKeown Transthoracic Esophagectomy
Ivor Lewis transthoracic esophagectomy (right thoracotomy and laparotomy)183 and McKeown transthoracic esophagectomy (right thoracotomy followed by laparotomy and cervical anastomosis)184 are the two most commonly used surgical techniques. Ivor Lewis esophagectomy, the most frequently used procedure for transthoracic esophagectomy, uses laparotomy and right thoracotomy, with upper thoracic esophagogastric anastomosis at or above the azygos vein.183 Mobilization of the stomach for use as the conduit is performed, with dissection of the celiac and left gastric lymph nodes, division of the left gastric artery, and preservation of the gastroepiploic and right gastric arteries. This approach may be used for distal thoracic lesions, but the proximal esophageal margin will be inadequate for tumors in the middle esophagus. McKeown esophagectomy, with an anastomosis in the cervical region, is similar in conduct, but with the advantage of being applicable for tumors in the upper, middle, and lower thoracic esophagus.
Transhiatal Esophagectomy
Transhiatal esophagectomy (laparotomy and cervical anastomosis) is performed using abdominal and left cervical incisions.185 The mobilization of the stomach for use as the conduit is performed as in the Ivor Lewis esophagectomy. This procedure is completed through the abdominal incision, and the gastric conduit is drawn through the posterior mediastinum and exteriorized in the cervical incision for the

esophagogastric anastomosis. This approach may be used for lesions at any thoracic location; however, transhiatal dissection of large, middle esophageal tumors adjacent to the trachea is difficult and may be hazardous. In a prospective trial involving 220 patients with adenocarcinoma of the mid-to-distal esophagus or gastric cardia, transhiatal esophagectomy was associated with lower post-surgical morbidity than transthoracic esophagectomy with extended en-bloc lymphadenectomy.186 In a large population-based study that assessed outcomes after transthoracic and transhiatal esophagectomy, transhiatal esophagectomy offered an early survival advantage. However, long-term survival was similar for the two surgical approaches.187 Although long-term survival differences have not been demonstrated, many experts believe that the lower lymph node retrieval associated with transhiatal esophagectomy represents a less effective oncologic approach. Therefore, transhiatal esophagectomy should not be used as a routine approach.
Left Transthoracic or Thoracoabdominal Esophagectomy
Left transthoracic or thoracoabdominal esophagectomy uses a contiguous abdominal and lef t thoracic incision through the eighth intercostal space.188 Mobilization of the stomach for use as the conduit is performed as previously described, and esophagectomy is accomplished through the left thoracotomy. Esophagogastric anastomosis is performed in the left chest, usually just superior to the inferior pulmonary vein, although it may be performed higher if the conduit is tunneled under the aortic arch. This approach may be used for lesions in the distal esophagus, particularly bulky tumors.188
Minimally Invasive Esophagectomy
Minimally invasive esophagectomy (MIE) strategies include minimally invasive Ivor Lewis esophagectomy (laparoscopy and limited right

thoracotomy) and minimally invasive McKeown esophagectomy (right thoracoscopy, limited laparotomy/laparoscopy, and cervical anastomosis). MIE strategies may be associated with decreased postoperative mortality, shorter recovery times, and increased long-term survival. In a phase II multicenter prospective study involving 104 patients with HGD or esophageal cancer of the mid-to-distal esophagus, the Ivor Lewis MIE strategy was shown to be safe and feasible, as demonstrated by low perioperative mortality (2.1%) and good oncologic results.189 Another study of MIE (mainly using thoracoscopic mobilization) involving 222 patients reported a mortality rate of only 1.4% and an average hospital stay of only 7 days, which is significantly less than most open procedures.190 However, it is important to note that 62% of patients in this study had early-stage disease. In a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies reporting long-term outcomes, patients had 18% lower 5-year all-cause mortality following MIE compared with open esophagectomy.191 In a multicenter randomized trial of 115 patients with esophageal or EGJ cancers, patients receiving MIE procedures had significantly lower rates of pulmonary infection than those receiving an open procedure.192 A randomized controlled trial found that a hybrid MIE approach, in which surgeons combined a laparoscopic abdominal access route with an open thoracotomy, resulted in lower incidence of postoperative complications.193 However, no statistically significant differences in either 3-year OS or DFS were observed. A retrospective analysis of 551 patients showed that patients who received MIE (n = 145) had significantly improved DFS and OS rates compared to patients who received open esophagectomy (n = 406; 3-year DFS rate, 81.7 vs. 69.3%, P = .021; 3-year OS rate, 89.9 vs. 79.2%, P = .007).194 Open esophagectomy may be preferred over MIE for certain patients with previous abdominal surgery, large and/or bulky tumors, possibly unusable gastric conduit, and difficulty with lymph node dissection. Although MIE is an evolving treatment option for patients with esophageal cancer, it is reasonable to replace invasive open procedures

with MIE when possible, especially in older patients or those with significant comorbidities.195-197
Robotic-assisted MIE is an emerging technique that of fers a realistic threedimensional (3D) view that facilitates dissection in the narrow working environment; however, it is expensive and typically requires longer operation time.198 The safety and feasibility of robotic-assisted MIE as compared to conventional MIE was analyzed in a systematic review and meta-analysis that reported similar rates of R0 resection, 30- and 90-day mortality, postoperative complications, and length of hospital stay between the two techniques.198 In a randomized controlled trial involving 112 patients, robotic-assisted MIE was associated with a lower percentage of postoperative and cardiopulmonary complications, decreased pain, improved functional recovery, and better postoperative quality of life compared to open esophagectomy.199 Oncologic outcomes were comparable at a median follow-up of 40 months. Another prospective trial involving 106 patients also reported lower postoperative pain severity and decreased pulmonary and infectious complications in patients receiving robotic-assisted MIE versus open esophagectomy.200 However, larger randomized controlled studies are needed to evaluate the benefits and risks of robotic-assisted MIE in patients with esophageal cancer.
Anastomosis and Choice of Conduit
The optimal location of the anastomosis has been debated. Potential advantages of a cervical anastomosis include more extensive resection of the esophagus, possibility of avoiding thoracotomy, less severe symptoms of reflux, and less severe complications related to anastomotic leakage. Advantages of a thoracic anastomosis may include lower incidence of anastomotic leakage, lower stricture rate, and lower rate of left recurrent nerve injury. In a prospective randomized trial, cervical and thoracic anastomoses after esophageal resection were equally safe when performed in a standardized way.201 Gastric conduit is preferred for

esophageal reconstruction by the majority of esophageal surgeons.202 Colon interposition is usually reserved for patients who have undergone previous gastric surgery or other procedures that might have devascularized the stomach.203
Endoscopic Therapies
Endoscopic therapies including ER (EMR or ESD) and endoscopic ablation (cryoablation or RFA) have been used as alternatives to surgery for the treatment of early-stage esophageal and EGJ cancers, with much less treatment-related morbidity than surgical resection. Several retrospective studies have demonstrated that ER and endoscopic ablation procedures are effective treatment options for select patients with Barrett esophagus and early-stage esophageal or EGJ cancers.204-207 In a SEER database analysis of 1458 patients with T1N0 esophageal cancer, the OS rates were similar after treatment with surgery or endoscopic therapy (EMR, RFA, cryoablation, or PDT). However, patients treated with endoscopic therapy had improved cancer-specific survival and decreased morbidity, supporting the use of endoscopic therapy as an effective treatment option for patients with early-stage disease.206
EMR is widely used for the treatment of early esophageal SCC in Japan and is gaining acceptance in Western countries for the treatment of Barrett esophagus and superficial adenocarcinomas.208-211 Complete Barrett eradication EMR (CBE-EMR) has been shown to be a highly effective long-term treatment option for patients with Barrett esophagus and HGD.212-216 ESD has also been established as a safe and effective procedure for patients with early-stage esophageal and EGJ cancers, resulting in high en-bloc resection rates and lower rates of major complications.217-220 Retrospective studies have reported significantly better en-bloc resection and local recurrence rates for ESD than for EMR in patients with early-stage SCC of the esophagus.221,222

RFA alone or in combination with ER is an effective treatment option for the complete eradication of residual dysplasia or Barrett esophagus.90,94,204,205,223-226 Endoscopic cryoablation has also been reported to be safe and well-tolerated in patients with Barrett esophagus and early-stage esophageal cancers.227,228 PDT with porfimer sodium or 5-aminolevulinic acid has produced excellent long-term results in patients with Barrett esophagus and HGD.229-231 However, the use of PDT as an endoscopic therapy for esophageal cancers is losing popularity due to the potential for long-term complications.
Principles of Endoscopy
Endoscopy has become an important tool in the diagnosis, staging, treatment, and surveillance of patients with esophageal and EGJ cancers. Most endoscopy procedures are performed with the aid of conscious sedation or monitored anesthesia provided by the endoscopist, nurse, nurse anesthetist, or anesthesiologist. Some patients who are at risk of aspiration during endoscopy may require general anesthesia. Endoscopic procedures are best performed in centers with experienced physicians.
Diagnosis
Diagnostic endoscopies are performed to determine the presence and location of esophageal neoplasia and to biopsy suspicious lesions. The location of the tumor relative to the teeth and EGJ, the length of the tumor, the degree of obstruction, and the extent of circumferential involvement should be carefully recorded to assist with treatment planning. Tumor length has been identified as an independent predictor of long-term survival in patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma, with improved 5-year survival rates for patients with a tumor length less than or equal to 2 cm compared to those with a tumor length greater than 2 cm.232 Highresolution endoscopic imaging and narrow-band imaging may be used to enhance visualization during endoscopy, with improved detection of
