Abstract
Objective To develop and validate a pretreatment magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)–based radiomic-clinical model to assess the treatment response of whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) by using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), which is derived from game theory, and can explain the output of different machine learning models. Methods We retrospectively enrolled 228 patients with brain metastases from two medical centers (184 in the training cohort and 44 in the validation cohort). Treatment responses of patients were categorized as a non-responding group vs. a responding group according to the Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology Brain Metastases (RANO-BM) criteria. For each tumor, 960 features were extracted from the MRI sequence. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) was used for feature selection. A support vector machine (SVM) model incorporating clinical factors and radiomic features wase used to construct the radiomic-clinical model. SHAP method explained the SVM model by prioritizing the importance of features, in terms of assessment contribution. Results Three radiomic features and three clinical factors were identified to build the model. Radiomic-clinical model yielded AUCs of 0.928 (95%CI 0.901–0.949) and 0.851 (95%CI 0.816–0.886) for assessing the treatment response in the training cohort and validation cohort, respectively. SHAP summary plot illustrated the feature’s value affected the feature’s impact attributed to model, and SHAP force plot showed the integration of features’ impact attributed to individual response. Conclusion The radiomic-clinical model with the SHAP method can be useful for assessing the treatment response of WBRT and may assist clinicians in directing personalized WBRT strategies in an understandable manner. Key Points
• Radiomic-clinical model can be useful for assessing the treatment response of WBRT. • SHAP could explain and visualize radiomic-clinical machine learning model in a clinician-friendly way.

Introduction
Brain metastases are a serious manifestation of cancer and are associated with poor clinical outcomes [1]. Despite recent advances in radiation oncology, neurosurgery, and systemic therapies, identifying an effective treatment for an individual patient with brain metastases remains a challenge [2–4]. Whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) irradiates the whole brain and targets patients with brain metastases who are not suitable for surgery or radiosurgery [1]. WBRT has the advantage of reducing the rate of recurrence and the emergence of new brain lesion [5]. In addition, according to clinical trials, patients with brain metastases who have good treatment responses, such as partial response (PR) or complete response (CR), usually have a higher overall survival (OS) [6, 7]. However, the objective response rate (ORR) of WBRT is not high, and nearly half of the patients cannot benefit from WBRT [8]. Meanwhile, the potential benefits of WBRT must be balanced against radiation-related side effects [9]. Therefore, precisely assessing the treatment response before WBRT is very important. At present, clinical factors, such as primary tumor type and disease-specific Graded Prognostic Assessments (DS-GPAs)
which is an objective prognostic scoring system for patients with brain metastases, are commonly used to assist the radiation oncologists in identifying proper WBRT strategies, whereas they are seldom applied to assess the WBRT treatment response directly [10–14]. With the development of advanced medical image techniques, diffusion MRI outlined viable tumor volume with linear mixed effect model; apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value with binomial regression; and water exchange rate constant metrics with Pearson correlation analysis have been proposed as alternatives to assess the treatment response of brain metastases radiotherapy. Although these models fulfill the demand of assessing the treatment response, they ignore the comprehensive information that can be obtained from MRI. Furthermore, these studies with insufficient validation which cannot satisfy clinical requirements. [15–17]. Radiomics could provide a better understanding of cancer pathophysiology for clinical decision-making by using a large number of quantitative image features to characterize the tumor heterogeneity [18]. Several studies have reported the successful use of radiomics to assess the treatment response of Gamma Knife radiosurgery or stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) therapy in patients with brain metastases [19–21]. However, the efficacy of radiomic approach on the discrimination of WBRT treatment response remains unknown. More importantly, the effectiveness of radiomics approach is influenced by many factors, such as imaging hardware configuration, image acquisition, image postprocessing, and software implementation; radiomics would encounter the problem of generalizability and would not be able to translate radiomic model into clinical practice [18, 22]. Therefore, a good model must be fully validated, especially external validation, in order to be applied in the clinic. In fact, many radiomic models have been developed and achieved good results in limited dataset or applications [23, 24]. However, radiation oncologists are hesitant to adopt such models due to the unclear internal mechanisms or unexplained features [25]. In other words, interpretability largely hinders the general application of the radiomic model. The SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method may help resolve this problem. SHAP is a unified framework of six different methods used for interpreting predictions, it defines a class of additive feature importance measures and theoretical results [26]. SHAP has several advantages, including illustrating the importance of the features and their impact on the overall prediction model and understanding the importance of individual features to the model output [27, 28]. The combination of SHAP and radiomics may illustrate models in an explicable way [29–31]. Thus, we constructed radiomic-clinical machine learning models to assess the treatment response of WBRT and verified the generalizability of models by external validation. Meanwhile, we combined models with the SHAP method to

Materials and methods
Study population
This retrospective clinical study was conducted in Hefei Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Sciences (cohort 1), and the First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University (cohort 2). The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and ethics review approval was obtained by the participating centers. A total of 228 patients with a histopathologic diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or breast cancer from the two centers were included. The inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria are shown in Supplementary Information 1. We used cohort 1 as the training cohort to train models for individual assessment. Then we used cohort 2 as the validation cohort to validate models. From the electronic medical record, demographic and clinical information were retrieved, including the following: gender, age, primary tumor type, radiation dose, biological equivalent dose, chemotherapy use, DS-GPAs scores, and followup days.
WBRT
WBRT was delivered with volumetric modulated arc therapy, and WBRT used 6 MV X-ray generated by medical accelerators (Elekta Axesse (4D) in the training cohort, Varian 23EX in the validation cohort). WBRT modalities were classified as follows: 40 Gy/20f, 37.5 Gy/15f, and 30 Gy/10f. Tumors received a boost dose ranging from 10 to 20 Gy through simultaneous or sequential radiotherapy to the BM lesions.
Assessment of WBRT treatment response
Each patient in the present study had a follow-up MRI for response assessment, typically between 6 and 8 weeks after the completion of radiation therapy. The Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology Brain Metastases (RANOBM) criteria were used to determine an outcome of CR (lesions that were not present on follow-up MRI), PR (> 30% reduction in the sum longest diameter of brain lesions), SD (neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD), and PD (> 20% increase in the sum longest diameter of brain lesions) [32]. ORR was widely demonstrated for assessing the treatment response, the proportion of patients with PR and CR
in all patients was defined as ORR [33]. Therefore, we included patients with PR/CR as the responding group and patients with PD/SD as the non-responding group. The detailed process of patient enrollment and grouping is shown in Fig. 1.
Clinical factors
Considering that these clinical factors were relatively important in clinical practice, primary tumor type, sex, and DSGPAs scores were used for clinical model construction regardless of their statistical significance in the training cohort and validation cohort. The DS-GPAs scores (Table 1) were calculated for all patients based on primary tumor type [11, 34]. At the same time, univariate analysis was used to assess the association between other clinical factors and WBRT treatment response in the training cohort and validation cohort, respectively. Significant clinical factors with p < 0.05 in the training cohort were identified as potential clinical risk factors and were included for clinical model building.
MRI data acquisition, image postprocessing, tumor segmentation, and feature extraction
All images were retrieved from a picture archiving and communication system (PACS). All patients from cohort 1 and cohort 2 underwent an MRI protocol, which included a contrast-enhanced T1-weighted (CET1-w) 3-dimensional (3D) sequence. The detailed processes of MRI data acquisition, image postprocessing, tumor segmentation, and feature extraction were described in Supplementary Information 2.
Quantitative radiomic analysis
For patients with multiple metastases, an average radiomic feature value of respective metastases was assigned to assess WBRT treatment response at the level of the individual patient. Feature selection was performed with the training cohort. Four steps were used for feature selection to reduce any bias of results and potential overfitting. The detailed process of quantitative radiomic analysis could be seen in Supplementary Information 3.
Model building
We constructed a clinical model and radiomic-based models (radiomic model and radiomic-clinical model). A widely used machine learning classifier of support vector machine (SVM) was used to classify patients into the PD/SD or CR/ PR groups [35]. SVM with two kernels (linear and radial basis function) models were conducted to optimize the

highest area under curve (AUC) value was chosen for computing the performance of the validation cohort.

Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve, specificity, sensitivity, precision, and AUC with a 95% confidence interval (95%CI) were calculated to assess the performance of SVM models [36]. The performance of different ROC curves in the training cohort and the validation cohort was then compared by the DeLong test. The calibration curves were used to assess the calibration of the SVM models in the training and validation cohort [37].
Model explanation and visualization
SHAP originated from a coalitional game theory that had been introduced to eliminate the black-box effect of machinelearning models, thereby enabling the identification and prioritization of features that determine compound classification [26–28]. Shapely (SHAP) value was the average expected marginal contribution of one player on the model after considering all possible combinations had been considered, and it was applied primarily to circumstances in which the contributions of each player were unequal, but players worked together to obtain the payoff [26, 28]. We used a SHAP kernel explainer to evaluate feature attributions, assuming that each feature of the patient was a player in a game where the prediction was the payout. The contribution of each player indicated the feature’s importance to the prediction. The workflow is shown in Fig. 2.
Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses were performed using Python version 3.5 (https: //www.python. org). Continuous variables were expressed as mean (SD) and compared using an unpaired, two-tailed t-test (continuous variables with a normal distribution) or Mann–Whitney test (continuous variables without a
normal distribution). Categorical variables were compared using the χ2 test or Fisher exact test. In all test analyses, p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The packages used in the study are listed in Supplementary Information 4.
Results
Patient characteristics
A total of 184 eligible patients with 512 brain metastases were enrolled from cohort 1. Among these, 96 patients with brain metastases were PD/SD (non-responding group), and 88 patients were CR/PR (responding group). A total of 44 eligible patients with 81 brain metastases were enrolled in cohort 2. Among these, 25 patients with brain metastases were PD/SD (non-responding group); and 19 patients were CR/PR (responding group). No significant differences were found in clinical characteristics between cohort 1 and cohort 2. Detailed clinical characteristics from two cohorts are shown in Supplementary Table 4.
Performance of clinical model to assess WBRT treatment response
Univariate analysis (Table 2) showed that no clinical factors were significantly related to the treatment response. Thus, primary tumor type, sex, and DS-GPAs scores were used for clinical model construction. The optimal SVM model used a linear kernel. Performances of the clinical model in the training cohort and validation cohort are shown in Table 3. The ROC curves with the clinical model in the training and validation cohorts are shown in Supplementary Fig. 1.

The clinical model with three factors yielded AUCs of 0.650 (95%CI 0.579–0.721) in the training cohort. In the validation cohort, the clinical model yielded an unsatisfying AUC of 0.598 (95%CI 0.589–0.607).
Radiomic feature selection
For each tumor, a total of 960 features were extracted from the CET1-w (3D) MR sequence. After univariate analysis, 548 features were selected. Considering the fact that a minimum of 10 patients per individual radiomic feature was investigated, as well as the sample size in this study, the coefficients of some radiomic features were subsequently compressed to zero by adding penalty terms [38]. Therefore, after LASSO regression, three features (Table 4) were selected. LASSO with 10-fold cross-validation and the LASSO coefficient are shown in Supplementary Fig. 2. Then, we calculated the Spearman correlation coefficients (Supplementary Fig. 3) between each pair of features, and no pair of features were excluded.
Performance of radiomic-based models to assess WBRT treatment response
The optimal SVM models used a linear kernel. The performances of radiomic-based models in the training cohort and the validation cohort are shown in Table 5. The ROC curves with radiomic-based models in the training and the validation cohorts are shown in Supplementary Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. 5. Radiomic-based models yielded satisfying integrated AUCs of 0.928, which were better than those of the clinical model in the training cohort. In the validation cohort, radiomic model and radiomic-clinical model also yielded good AUCs of 0.837 (95%CI 0.827–0.847) and 0.851 (95%CI 0.8160.886), which were better than those of the clinical model. The ROC curves of SVM models in the training cohort and validation cohort are shown in Fig. 3. The p values of Delong test were both smaller than 0.01 when comparing the radiomic-based models with the clinical model. Calibration plots graphically showed good agreements of radiomic-based models between the actual rate and predicted

Explanation and visualization of radiomic-clinical model
SHAP provided a quantitative explanation for the SVM method. SHAP summary plots offered a visually concise figure by representing the range and distribution of importance that feature had on the model’s output and by relating the feature’s value to the feature’s impact. Features were sorted by their global importance first. Each dot representing the SHAP value of each feature from a patient was plotted horizontally and was stacked vertically to show the density of the same SHAP value. Then, each dot was colored by the value of the feature, from low (blue) to high (red). In Fig. 4, we observed that CET1-w (3D)_firstoderM was the most important feature for discriminating PD/SD classification. The density of CET1-w (3D)_firstoderM plot showed that the SHAP values of this feature were different in the cohort, and the coloring showed that the model’s output increased with decreasing value of this feature. The force plot (Fig. 5) could interpret the assessment of a single patient. It visualized the SHAP value of a feature as a force to increase or decrease the assessment, and every prediction began with the base value (0.5566), which was the average SHAP value of all predictions. The arrow’s length accounted for how much (in percentage) a particular feature contributed to the SHAP value. The arrow’s color represented whether the contributions were positive (red) or negative (blue). As shown in Fig. 5A, the SHAP value of this patient was 0.80, which was larger than the base value (0.5566), thereby indicating that we could assess this patient in the non
responding classification. Among these features, positive (red) CET1-w (3D)_firstoderM arrow with a value of −1.222 had a great contribution to the assessment of the non-responding group. As shown in Fig. 5B, for another patient, the SHAP value was 0.12 which was smaller than the base value (0.5566). Thus, we could assess that this patient belonged to the responding group. CET1-w(3D)_firstoderM arrow with a value of 0.09947 made a negative (blue) effort to assess non-responding classification.
Discussion
We demonstrated that radiomic-based SVM models had a good ability to assess the treatment response of WBRT, and the external validation also showed good generalizability. We found AUCs of radiomic-based models were better than the clinical model in assessing the treatment response. DS-GPA scores were an important biomarker among the clinical factors. Patients with high DS-GPA scores were classified as the responding group. However, the clinical model with DS-GPAs scores performed poorly, and a little improvement was observed when clinical factors were added to the radiomic model. DSGPAs are used to classify patients with brain metastases into different prognostic groups [11]. Patients with good performance status and limited metastatic lesions are usually classified by DSGPAs as a good prognostic, which is recommended to receive SRS. However, in a previous SRS study, no significant difference was found in the overall survival of patients with different numbers of metastatic lesions, indicating that the clinical model with DS-GPAs was unreliable when used to assess the treatment response of radiotherapy [39]. Despite clinical model having a limited ability to assess the treatment response of WBRT,

radiomic-based models showed a good performance, which may direct radiation oncologists to personalize the treatment of patients with brain metastases For the development and validation of radiomic-based models, we selected three radiomic features. Feature extraction inherently extracted more than a million voxels per MR imaging sequence into a handful of radiomic features, and strong radiomic features were stable in different scanners and captured distinctive tumor information [40]. According to the result of external validation, radiomic-based models showed good performance and generalizability. The underlying reason for this finding may be the fact that radiomic-based models had strong features that helped capture distinct patterns correlated with WBRT treatment response.
Strong features were obtained from CET1-w (3D) MR sequence. Different MR imaging sequences exploit different biophysical properties of brain tumors. CET1-w (3D) MR sequence could reflect enhancing regions (that show variations in blood flow) and necrosis due to gadolinium leakage from the intravascular space into the tumor [41]. CET1-w (3D) MR sequence also provides detailed anatomical information with high spatial resolution [42, 43]. Therefore, CET1-w (3D) MR sequence shows good sensitivity when used for the detection of brain metastases and is useful in clinical practice. Given the advantages of CET1-w (3D) MR sequence, we only used this MR sequence for the easy generalization of our radiomic-based models. However, the validation cohort was scanned with a different MRI protocol in the presented study,

and different MRI protocols may be a risk of bias and would affect the generalizability of radiomic model; for example, the intensity of images was not quantitative. Thereby image postprocessing including resampling and intensity normalization was performed to improve the generalizability of radiomics. Consistent with a previous study [21], our radiomic-based models built with SVM showed good performance. Although SVM-based models are widely used and powerful [44, 45], they cannot be applied to clinical practice unless the model can be explained. SHAP could provide an explanation and visualization of SVM models in a clinician-friendly way through the SHAP summary plot and SHAP force plot. From a global perspective, the SHAP summary plot could provide a visually concise figure by representing the range and distribution of importance that features impact on the model’s output (the more important the feature, the wider dots’ range) and by relating the feature’s value to the feature’s impact, from low (blue) to high (red), thereby providing a new alternative feature importance plots of the whole cohort. By contrast, the ordinary feature importance bar only offered relative importance. In this study, clinicians could clearly see how the CET1-w (3D)_firstoderM or other features’ value impacted the assessment through dots’ range and color. At the same time, clinicians can simultaneously identify the strongest feature of the model. Pathophysiologically, SHAP offered us the strongest nonsemantic feature CET1w(3D)_firstoderM [46]. “CET1-w (3D)_firstoderM” described the median percentile of gray values within the volume [47].In this study, patients in the non-responding group had low “CET1-w(3D)_firstoderM” than patients in the responding group; thus, images of non-responding tumors were rather dark. This result may indicate the lack of a gadolinium-based contrast agent due to poor vascular supply. With regard to the mechanism of radiation resistance, tumors with poor vascular support, which would result in hypoxic
conditions, usually showed resistant outcome [48]. The findings of the present study confirmed a previous study that heterogeneity and high gray levels might be associated with intertwined processes, such as chaotic vascularization [49]. To our knowledge, this study was the first to assess the WBRT treatment response by integrating radiomics with the SHAP method. After clinicians understanding how features impacted the SVM model and the potential pathophysiological mechanism, they would like to use this model to assess individual outcomes. From the perspective of an individual patient, a local explanation of a single patient’s assessment could be implemented by using a SHAP force plot. Compared with the nomogram method, which made clinicians calculate some features’ value to generate total points [50], the SHAP force plot was time-saving and easier to use. Clinicians could compare the output SHAP value of a single patient with the base value directly. In the presented model, if the output SHAP value was bigger than base value, clinicians could classify this patient into the non-responding group. At the same time, clinicians could realize how features impacted an individual patient’s assessment through seeing arrow’s color (red color describes a force to increase the assessment for the non-responding group) and arrow’s length which described how much a particular feature contributed to the assessment. As shown in Fig. 5A (red), CET1-w (3D)_firstoderM and (red) CET1-w (3D)_sigma1_glcmI had a positive contribution to the assessment of the non-responding group, and the arrow’s length of CET1-w (3D)_firstoderM was longer than CET1-w (3D)_sigma1_glcmI, indicating that CET1-w (3D)_firstoderM contributed more force to the assessment than CET1-w (3D)_sigma1_glcmI. The present study had some limitations. First, considering the generalizability and practicability of the model, we did not use multiparameter-MRI. However, other MR sequences may contain other biophysical properties of brain tumors that could
Fig. 5 SHAP force plots explained how the radiomic-clinical model discriminates the treatment response of two patients. The treatment response of patient A was PD/SD (non-responding group), and the treatment response of patient B was CR/PR (responding group). For instance, low feature value of CET1-w(3D)_firstoderM contributed to the increase in
the assessment probability of the non-responding group. Patient B had a CET1-w(3D)_firstoderM value of 0.09947, while a lower CET1-w(3D)_ firstoderM value of patient A (−1.222) contributed to assessing the nonresponding group. Primary tumor type: 0 = non-small cell lung carcinoma;1 = breast cancer. Sex: 0 = male; 1 = female

help assess the treatment response of WBRT. Therefore, multiparameter-MRI-based radiomics would be explored next. Second, although the situation that two features that were strongly correlated but represented different biophysiological characteristics did not happen in the presented study, in order to better understand how these features contributed to the model, if such a situation occurs, we should include both features in the further analysis. Third, SHAP offered the strongest radiomic feature, but the pathological mechanism could not be associated with radiomic features directly. Local microscopic pathological image features and macroscopic histopathologic marker expression are encouraged in further analyses. Lastly, we used consensus ROIs for feature extraction to guarantee the accuracy of tumor segmentation and reduce the heterogeneity among radiation oncologists, which would result in the loss of partial tumor area information [51]. An automatic or semi-automatic tumor segmentation approach will be developed next.
Conclusions
The proposed radiomic-clinical machine learning model that contained CET1-w (3D) MR sequence features can be useful for assessing the treatment response of WBRT. The SHAP method may assist clinicians in directing personalizing WBRT strategies in an understandable way.
