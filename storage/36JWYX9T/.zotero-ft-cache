h Evaluation by a gynecologic oncologist is recommended for: • All patients with suspected ovarian malignancies; published data demonstrate that primary assessment and debulking by a gynecologic oncologist results in a survival advantage. • Patients being evaluated for neoadjuvant therapy prior to being considered a poor surgical candidate. • Management of occult STICs. • Consideration of laparoscopic evaluation to determine feasibility of debulking surgery in select patients. • Endometrial biopsy as clinically indicated.

evidence of residual disease, it can be important for determining the most appropriate postoperative management options, including selection of adjuvant and maintenance therapy.

Note: All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated. Clinical Trials: NCCN believes that the best management of any patient with cancer is in a clinical trial. Participation in clinical trials is especially encouraged.

f See Principles of Systemic Therapy (OV-C) and Management of Drug Reactions (OV-D).
o Validated molecular testing should be performed in a CLIA-approved facility using the most recent available tumor tissue. Tumor molecular analysis is recommended to include, at a minimum, tests to identify potential benefit from targeted therapeutics that have tumor-specific or tumor-agnostic benefit including, but not limited to, HER2 status (by IHC), BRCA1/2, HRD status, MSI, MMR, TMB, BRAF, FRα (FOLR1), RET, and NTRK if prior testing did not include these markers. More comprehensive testing may be particularly important in LCOC with limited approved therapeutic options (OV-B).
p CT is performed with oral and IV contrast (unless contraindicated) and rectal contrast as needed.

q There are data regarding the utility of CA-125 for monitoring of ovarian cancer after completion of primary therapy. See The Society of Gynecologic Oncology (SGO) position statement and Discussion.
r See NCCN Guidelines for Genetic/Familial High-Risk Assessment: Breast, Ovarian, and Pancreatic and NCCN Guidelines for Genetic/Familial High-Risk Assessment: Colorectal.
s There is no standard sequencing of drugs for recurrent disease. Considerations include prior therapies, disease burden, relative efficacy, and relative toxicity profile.
t Consider secondary cytoreduction in patients with long disease-free interval, isolated masses rather than diffuse carcinomatosis on imaging, and/or bowel obstruction.
u An aromatase inhibitor (ie, letrozole, anastrozole, exemestane) is preferred if not used previously. Fulvestrant, leuprolide acetate, or goserelin acetate is recommended if an aromatase inhibitor was given previously.
v Data are limited on maintenance therapy for recurrent/resistant LCOC. See OV-8 for maintenance options after platinum-based therapy, and patient selection criteria.

Note: All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated. Clinical Trials: NCCN believes that the best management of any patient with cancer is in a clinical trial. Participation in clinical trials is especially encouraged.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2024 Ovarian Cancer/Fallopian Tube Cancer/Primary Peritoneal Cancer

NCCN Guidelines Index Table of Contents Discussion

PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY1

General Considerations • It is recommended that a gynecologic oncologist perform the appropriate surgery. • An open laparotomy including a vertical midline abdominal incision should be used in most patients with a suspected malignant ovarian/
fallopian tube/primary peritoneal neoplasm in whom a surgical staging procedure, a primary debulking procedure, an interval debulking procedure, or secondary cytoreduction is planned. For select patients, a minimally invasive surgical approach may be employed by an experienced surgeon to manage early-stage disease.
Laparoscopy may be useful to evaluate whether optimal cytoreduction can be achieved in patients with newly diagnosed advanced-stage or recurrent disease. Minimally invasive techniques can be used for select patients for interval debulking procedures. Patients who are unable to be optimally debulked using minimally invasive techniques should be converted to an open procedure. • Intraoperative pathologic evaluation with frozen sections may assist in management. • Prior to surgery for ovarian cancer, counsel patients about port placement if intraperitoneal (IP) chemotherapy is being considered.
Operative Reports • Surgeons should describe the following in the operative report: Extent of initial disease before debulking pelvis, mid-abdomen, or upper abdomen (cutoffs: pelvic brim to lower ribs). Amount of residual disease in the same areas after debulking. Complete or incomplete resection; if incomplete, indicate the size of the major lesion and total number of lesions. Indicate if miliary or
small lesions.

NCCN Guidelines Index Table of Contents Discussion

PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY1

Newly Diagnosed Invasive Epithelial Ovarian Cancer Apparently Confined to the Ovaries, Fallopian Tubes, and Uterus (apparent stage IA–IIA) In general, every effort should be made during a primary cytoreduction procedure to achieve maximum cytoreduction of all pelvic disease and to evaluate for occult disease in the upper abdomen or retroperitoneum. • On entering the abdomen, aspiration of ascites or peritoneal lavage should be performed for peritoneal cytologic examinations. • All peritoneal surfaces should be visualized, and any peritoneal surface or adhesion suspicious for harboring metastasis should be
selectively excised or biopsied. In the absence of any suspicious areas, random peritoneal biopsies should be taken from the pelvis, paracolic gutters, and undersurfaces of the diaphragm (diaphragm scraping for Papanicolaou stain is an acceptable alternative). • BSO and hysterectomy should be performed with every effort to keep an encapsulated mass intact during removal. • For selected patients desiring to preserve fertility, USO or BSO with uterine preservation may be considered. Uterine preservation allows for potential future assisted reproductive approaches. • Omentectomy should be performed. • Para-aortic lymph node dissection should be performed by stripping the nodal tissue from the vena cava and the aorta bilaterally to at least the level of the inferior mesenteric artery and preferably to the level of the renal vessels. • The preferred method of dissecting pelvic lymph nodes is bilateral removal of lymph nodes overlying and anterolateral to the common iliac vmeisnsimelu, movaenrltyeirniogratnodthmeeodbiatul troattohreneexrtveer.n2al iliac vessel, overlying and medial to the hypogastric vessels, and from the obturator fossa at a

• Aspiration of ascites (if present) should be performed for peritoneal cytologic examinations. All involved omentum should be removed.

• Suspicious and/or enlarged nodes, identified on preoperative imaging or during surgical exploration, should be resected, if possible. Resection of clinically negative nodes is not required.4

• Procedures that may be considered for optimal surgical cytoreduction (in all stages) include bowel resection and/or appendectomy, stripping

of the diaphragm or other peritoneal surfaces, splenectomy, partial cystectomy and/or ureteroneocystostomy, partial hepatectomy, partial

gastrectomy, cholecystectomy, and/or distal pancreatectomy.

• Select patients with low-volume residual disease after surgical cytoreduction for invasive epithelial ovarian or peritoneal cancer are potential

candidates for IP therapy. In these patients, consideration should be given to placement of IP catheter with initial surgery.

PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY1

Interval Debulking Surgery After Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy of Invasive Epithelial Ovarian Cancer As with a primary debulking procedure, every effort should be made to achieve maximum cytoreduction during an interval debulking procedure. Maximal effort should be made to remove all gross disease in the abdomen, pelvis, and retroperitoneum. Consultation with a gynecologic oncologist is recommended. • IDS, including completion hysterectomy and BSO with
staging, should be performed after 3–4 cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy for patients with a response to chemotherapy or stable disease. Alternate timing of surgery has not been prospectively evaluated but may be considered based on individual patient-centered factors. • Hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) with cisplatin (100 mg/m2) can be considered at the time of IDS for stage III disease. Sodium thiosulfate may be administered at the start of perfusion, followed by a continuous infusion, to allow for renal protection during HIPEC. • All peritoneal surfaces should be visualized, and any peritoneal surface or adhesion suspicious for harboring metastasis should be selectively excised or biopsied. • An omentectomy should be performed. • Suspicious and/or enlarged nodes should be resected, if possible. Removal of lymph nodes noted to have potential metastasis at the time of initial diagnosis should be considered, even if not currently suspicious or enlarged. • Procedures that may be considered for optimal surgical debulking include bowel resection and/or appendectomy, stripping of the diaphragm or other peritoneal surfaces, splenectomy, partial cystectomy and/ or ureteroneocystostomy, partial hepatectomy, partial gastrectomy, cholecystectomy, and/or distal pancreatectomy.

Risk-Reducing Salpingo-Oophorectomy (RRSO) Protocol

• For information on when RRSO is indicated, see NCCN Guidelines for

Genetic/Familial High-Risk Assessment: Breast, Ovarian, and Pancreatic.

• Perform minimally invasive laparoscopic surgery.

• Survey upper abdomen, bowel surfaces, omentum, appendix (if present),

and pelvic organs.

• Biopsy any abnormal peritoneal findings.

• Obtain pelvic washing for cytology (50 cc normal saline instilled and

aspirated immediately).

• Perform total BSO, removing 2 cm of proximal ovarian vasculature/IP

ligament, all tube up to the cornua, and all peritoneum surrounding the

ovaries and tubes, especially peritoneum between tube and/or ovary and the pelvic

of

adhesion

• tErnaugmagaetiicnemxfionliimataiol innsotfrcuemllesn.5t handling of the tubes and ovaries to avoid

• Both ovaries and tubes should be placed in an endobag for retrieval

from the pelvis.

• Both ovaries and tubes should be processed by sectioning and extensively examining the fimbriated end (SEE-FIM) protocol.6

• If occult malignancy or serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma (STIC) is

identified, provide referral to a gynecologic oncologist.

• The prevention benefits of salpingectomy alone are not yet proven.

If considered, the fallopian tube from the fimbria to its insertion into

the uterus should be removed. In addition, the fallopian tube should

be processed and assessed as described above. The concern for

risk-reducing salpingectomy alone is that patients are still at risk for

developing ovarian cancer. In addition, in premenopausal patients,

oophorectomy reduces the risk of developing breast cancer but the

magnitude is uncertain. See NCCN Guidelines for Genetic/Familial High-

Risk Assessment: Breast, Ovarian, and Pancreatic.

PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY1

Special Circumstances • Fertility-sparing surgery: Fertility-sparing surgery with USO (preserving the uterus and contralateral ovary) or BSO (preserving the uterus) can be considered for
patients with apparent early-stage disease and/or low-risk tumors (early-stage invasive epithelial tumors, LMP lesions, malignant germ cell tumors, mucinous tumors, or malignant sex cord-stromal tumors) who wish to preserve fertility. Refer to reproductive endocrinologist for evaluation and REI consultation as clinically indicated. Comprehensive surgical staging should still be performed to rule out occult higher stage disease but may be omitted in pediatric, adolescent, and young adult patients with clinically apparent early-stage malignant germ cell tumors based on the pediatric surgical literature.7 • Mucinous tumors: Primary invasive mucinous tumors of the ovary are uncommon. Thus, the upper and lower GI tract should be carefully evaluated to rule out an occult GI primary with ovarian metastases, and an appendectomy need only be performed in patients with a suspected or confirmed mucinous ovarian neoplasm if it appears to be abnormal. A normal appendix does not require surgical resection in this setting. If mucinous histology is confirmed by intraoperative frozen section analysis and there are no suspicious lymph nodes, consider omitting lymphadenectomy. • Ovarian borderline epithelial (LMP) tumors: Although data show upstaging with lymphadenectomy, other data show that lymphadenectomy does not affect overall survival. However, omentectomy and multiple biopsies of peritoneum (the most common sites of peritoneal implants) may upstage patients in approximately 30% of cases and may affect prognosis. • Secondary cytoreduction: A secondary cytoreduction procedure can be considered in patients with recurrent ovarian cancer who develop a recurrence more than 6 months since completion of initial chemotherapy, have a good performance status, have no ascites, and have an isolated focus or limited foci of disease amenable to complete resection. In addition to preoperative imaging, laparoscopy may be used to determine if complete resection can be achieved. Secondary cytoreduction can be performed with either open or minimally invasive approaches. Consider using validated scoring methods to assess suitability for secondary cytoreduction.
Ancillary Palliative Surgical Procedures8 These procedures may be appropriate in select patients: • Paracentesis/indwelling peritoneal catheter • Thoracentesis/pleurodesis/video-assisted thoracoscopy/indwelling pleural catheter • Ureteral stents/nephrostomy • Gastrostomy tube/intestinal stents/surgical relief of intestinal obstruction

PRINCIPLES OF PATHOLOGY

General • The complete histologic classification from the WHO is included in
the NCCN Guidelines (WHO Histologic Classification on OV-E).1 The WHO pathology manual is also a useful resource.1 • Most ovarian cancers, including the LCOC, are diagnosed after pathologic analysis of a biopsy or surgical specimen. Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) should be avoided for diagnosis of ovarian cancer in patients with presumed early-stage disease to prevent rupturing the cyst and spilling malignant cells into the peritoneal cavity. However, FNA may be necessary in patients with bulky disease who are not candidates for primary debulking.2,3 • Both primary peritoneal and fallopian tube cancers are usually diagnosed postoperatively (if there is no major involvement of the ovary) or preoperatively (if there is a biopsy and the patient has already had a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy). Primary peritoneal and fallopian tube cancers are treated in the same manner as epithelial ovarian cancer. • The CAP protocol is a useful tool for pathology reports.4 Pathologic assessment should include: Elements from CAP protocol:4
◊ Tumor site(s) (eg, ovary, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneum) ◊ Tumor size(s) ◊ Other tissue/organ involvement ◊ Ovarian/fallopian tumors: surface involvement (present/absent/
cannot determine), specimen integrity (capsule/serosa intact/ fractured/fragmented) ◊ Histologic type and grade ◊ Extension and/or implants (if sampled/identified) ◊ Cytology: peritoneal or ascitic fluid or washings/pleural fluid ◊ Lymph nodes: number and location of nodes examined, size of largest metastatic deposits ◊ STIC, endometriosis (particularly if in continuity with endometrioid or clear cell carcinoma), and/or endosalpingiosis ◊ Staging information (FIGO and TNM)

• Tumor molecular analyses In the upfront setting, choice of somatic testing should, at a
minimum, optimize identification of molecular alterations that can inform use of interventions that have demonstrated benefit in this setting, including BRCA1/2, loss of heterozygosity (LOH), or homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) status in the absence of a germline BRCA mutation. In the recurrence setting, tumor molecular analysis is recommended to include, as appropriate, tests to identify potential benefit from targeted therapeutics that have tumorspecific or tumor-agnostic benefit including, but not limited to, HER2 status (by IHC), BRCA1/2, HRD status, microsatellite instability (MSI), mismatch repair (MMR), tumor mutational burden (TMB), BRAF, FRα (FOLR1), RET, and NTRK if prior testing did not include these markers. More comprehensive testing may be particularly important in less common histologies with limited approved therapeutic options. It is recommended that such testing be performed on the most recent available tumor tissue. Molecular analyses may be performed on circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA or liquid biopsy) when tissue-based analysis is not clinically feasible. Validated molecular testing should be performed in a CLIAapproved facility.

Less Common Ovarian Cancers (LCOC) • A borderline tumor is a primary epithelial lesion with cytologic characteristics suggesting malignancy but without frank invasion. The terms
for borderline epithelial tumors (also known as LMP tumors or atypical proliferative tumors) have changed over the years.5 The 2023 CAP protocol for ovarian cancer uses borderline and does not use LMP.4 Borderline epithelial tumors are typically serous or mucinous; other histologic subtypes can also occur (WHO Histologic Classification on OV-E).1,6 The characteristic pathologic hallmark of typical epithelial ovarian cancer is the identification of peritoneal implants, which microscopically and/or macroscopically invade the peritoneum. A borderline epithelial tumor may grossly resemble an invasive cancer. However, microscopic evaluation fails to reveal evidence of frank invasion by the tumor nodules, although rarely invasive implants (which continue to be consistent with the diagnosis of borderline epithelial lesions) can be identified microscopically by the pathologist. • Clear cell carcinomas are high-grade tumors that may arise in endometriosis. Most clear cell carcinomas express napsin A and are negative for WT1 and estrogen receptors.5 • It is difficult to distinguish based on histology between primary mucinous ovarian carcinomas and GI metastases.7,8,9 PAX8 immunostaining is typical of primary ovarian tumors, although the absence of PAX8 does not rule out ovary as the primary site,10 while SATB2 is consistent with colonic origin.11 Metastatic colorectal adenocarcinomas also usually are positive for CK20 and CEA. • Endometrioid carcinomas may be associated with endometriosis.10,12 Endometrioid adenocarcinomas are usually positive for cytokeratin 7 (CK7), PAX8, CA-125, and estrogen receptors. Endometrioid tumors are also very similar in appearance to sex cord-stromal tumors.5 • Most pathologists now consider MMMTs to be a variant of poorly differentiated epithelial ovarian cancer (metaplastic carcinoma).13
Special Circumstances • Other cancers14,15 that can commonly involve the adnexa include: Uterine Cervical GI (small and large bowel, pancreatic) Lymphoma • For risk-reducing surgery, pathologic assessment should include the following: Fallopian tubes should be processed by SEE-FIM of the tubes and then assessed to determine whether any evidence of cancer is present.4 The ovaries should also be carefully sectioned, processed, and assessed.4 The 2023 CAP protocol describes the process for sectioning the
fallopian tubes and ovaries.4 • Patients who have equivocal pathologic findings or who are referred to NCCN Member Institutions after having a previous diagnosis of
ovarian cancer should have their pathology reviewed by pathologists at NCCN Member Institutions.

PRINCIPLES OF SYSTEMIC THERAPY

General • Patients with ovarian, fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer
should be encouraged to participate in clinical trials during all aspects of their diagnosis and treatment. • Prior to recommending chemotherapy, requirements for adequate organ function and performance status should be met. • Prior to the initiation of any therapy: All patients with suspected stage IIIC or IV invasive
epithelial ovarian cancer should be evaluated by a gynecologic oncologist prior to initiation of therapy to determine whether they are candidates for primary cytoreductive surgery (PCS). Patients of childbearing potential who desire fertilitysparing procedures should be referred to an appropriate fertility specialist (NCCN Guidelines for Adolescent and Young Adult (AYA) Oncology). Goals of systemic therapy should be discussed. • Consider scalp cooling to reduce incidence of alopecia for patients receiving chemotherapy with high rates of alopecia. • Patients should be observed closely and treated for any complications during chemotherapy. Appropriate blood chemistry tests should be monitored. Appropriate dose reductions and modifications of chemotherapy should be performed depending on toxicities experienced and goals of therapy. • After completion of chemotherapy, patients should be assessed for response during and following treatment and monitored for any long-term complications. • Chemosensitivity/resistance and/or other biomarker assays are being used at some NCCN Member Institutions for decisions related to future chemotherapy in situations where there are multiple equivalent chemotherapy options available. The current level of evidence is not sufficient to supplant standard-of-care chemotherapy (category 3).

Definitions Used in the NCCN Guidelines for Ovarian Cancer • Adjuvant therapy: Drugs, radiation, or other forms of supplemental treatment
following cancer surgery intended to decrease the risk of disease recurrence or to primarily treat residual disease, whether gross or microscopic, following surgical cytoreduction. • Neoadjuvant therapy: Drugs, radiation, or other forms of treatment given prior to cancer surgery intended to reduce tumor burden in preparation for surgery. • Recurrence therapy: Drugs, radiation, or other forms of treatment used to treat recurrent cancer, control symptoms, or increase length and/or quality of life at the time of clinical, biochemical, or radiographic evidence of recurrent cancer following the initial treatment.
For Patients with Newly Diagnosed Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, or Primary Peritoneal Cancer: • If they are eligible for chemotherapy, patients should be informed about
the different primary therapy options that are available—such as IV chemotherapy, a combination of IP and IV chemotherapy, or a clinical trial— so they can decide which is the most appropriate option. • Prior to the administration of the combined IP and IV regimen, patients must be apprised of the increased toxicities with the combined regimen when compared to using IV chemotherapy alone (increased myelosuppression, renal toxicities, abdominal pain, neuropathy, GI toxicities, metabolic toxicities, and hepatic toxicities). • Patients considered for the IP cisplatin and IP/IV paclitaxel regimen should have normal renal function prior to starting, a medically appropriate performance status based on the future toxicities of the IP/IV regimen, and no prior evidence of medical problems that could significantly worsen during chemotherapy (eg, pre-existing neuropathy). • Prior to receiving and after receiving each cycle of IP cisplatin, adequate amounts of IV fluids need to be administered in order to prevent renal toxicity. After each cycle has been completed, patients need to be monitored carefully for myelosuppression, dehydration, electrolyte loss, end-organ toxicities (such as renal and hepatic damage), and all other toxicities. Patients often require IV fluids postchemotherapy in the outpatient setting to prevent or help treat dehydration. • Refer to the original references (Discussion) for full toxicity data, doses, schedule, and dose modifications.

Note: All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated. Clinical Trials: NCCN believes that the best management of any patient with cancer is in a clinical trial. Participation in clinical trials is especially encouraged.

PRINCIPLES OF SYSTEMIC THERAPY Principles of Neoadjuvant Therapy • Consider the histology of the primary tumor and the potential response to primary chemotherapy when evaluating for neoadjuvant
chemotherapy. • Any of the primary IV regimens for stage II–IV high-grade serous carcinoma can be used as neoadjuvant therapy before IDS. See OV-C (6 of
12). • Bevacizumab-containing regimens should be used with caution before IDS due to potential interference with postoperative healing. If
bevacizumab is being used as part of a neoadjuvant regimen, bevacizumab should be withheld from therapy for 4–6 weeks prior to IDS. • After neoadjuvant therapy and IDS any of the adjuvant therapy options for high-grade serous carcinoma (IV or IP/IV) can be considered. See
OV-C (6 of 12). • There are limited data for the use of IP chemotherapy regimens after neoadjuvant therapy and IDS. The following is an additional IP option
after IDS: paclitaxel 135 mg/m2 IV on Day 1, carboplatin area under the curve (AUC) 6 IP on Day 1, and paclitaxel 60 mg/m2 IP on Day 8.a • A minimum of 6 cycles of treatment is recommended, including at least 3 cycles of adjuvant therapy after IDS. Patients with stable disease
who are tolerating therapy may continue past 6 cycles.

NCCN Guidelines Index Table of Contents Discussion

PRINCIPLES OF SYSTEMIC THERAPY

Recurrent Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, or Primary Peritoneal Cancer: • Refer to the original references (Discussion) for full toxicity data, doses, schedule, and dose modifications. • Patients should be informed about the following:
1) Availability of clinical trials, including the risks and benefits of various treatments, which will depend on the number of prior lines of chemotherapy the patient has received, and
2) Performance status, end-organ status, and pre-existing toxicities from prior regimens. If appropriate, palliative care should also be discussed as a possible treatment choice. See NCCN Guidelines for Palliative Care.
• Tumor molecular testing is recommended if not previously done for persistent/recurrent disease. See Principles of Pathology (OV-B). • Because of prior platinum exposure, myelosuppression occurs more frequently with any myelotoxic agent given in the recurrent setting. • With repeat use of either carboplatin and/or cisplatin, patients are at an increased risk of developing a hypersensitivity reaction (also
called an allergic reaction) that could be life-threatening. Thus, patients should be counseled about the risk that a hypersensitivity reaction may occur, educated about the signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions, treated by medical staff who know how to manage hypersensitivity reactions, and treated in a medical setting where appropriate medical equipment is available in case of an allergic reaction. See Management of Drug Reactions (OV-D). • Before any chemotherapy drug is given in the recurrent setting, the clinician should be familiar with the drug’s metabolism (ie, renal, hepatic) and should make certain that the patient is an appropriate candidate for the drug (eg, that the patient has adequate renal or hepatic function). • Clinicians should be familiar with toxicity management and appropriate dose reduction. • The schedule, toxicity, and potential benefits of any treatment should be thoroughly discussed with the patient and caregivers. Patient education should also include a discussion of precautions and measures to reduce the severity and duration of complications.

before initiating maintenance therapy with a PARPi. u Many of these single-agent cytotoxic therapy options have not been tested in patients who have been treated with modern chemotherapy regimens. v For patients treated with three or more prior chemotherapy regimens and whose cancer is associated with HRD defined by either: 1) a deleterious or suspected
deleterious BRCA mutation; or 2) genomic instability and progression >6 months after response to the last platinum-based chemotherapy. w For patients with deleterious germline BRCA-mutated (as detected by an FDA-approved test or other validated test performed in a CLIA-approved facility) advanced
ovarian cancer who have been treated with two or more lines of chemotherapy. x For patients with deleterious germline and/or somatic BRCA mutated (as detected by an FDA-approved test or other validated test performed in a CLIA-approved facility)
advanced ovarian cancer who have been treated with two or more lines of chemotherapy. y For recommended dosing for individuals >70 years, see OV-C, 7 of 12. z Validated molecular testing should be performed in a CLIA-approved facility using the most recent available tumor tissue. Tumor molecular analysis is recommended to
include, at a minimum, tests to identify potential benefit from targeted therapeutics that have tumor-specific or tumor-agnostic benefit including, but not limited to, HER2 status (by IHC), BRCA1/2, HRD status, MSI, MMR, TMB, BRAF, FRα (FOLR1), RET, and NTRK if prior testing did not include these markers. More comprehensive testing may be particularly important in LCOC with limited approved therapeutic options (OV-B). aa For those previously treated with taxanes.

MANAGEMENT OF DRUG REACTIONS

Overview • Virtually all drugs used in oncology have the potential to cause
adverse drug reactions while being infused, which can be classified as either infusion or allergic reactions.1 Infusion reactions are often characterized by milder symptoms
(eg, hot flushing, rash). Hypersensitivity (allergic) reactions are often characterized by
more severe symptoms (eg, shortness of breath, generalized hives/itching, changes in blood pressure). • Most adverse drug reactions that occur are mild reactions, but more severe reactions can occur.2,3 Anaphylaxis is a rare type of very severe allergic reaction that can occur with platinum and taxane agents (and others less commonly), can cause cardiovascular collapse, and can be lifethreatening.4-6 Drug reactions can occur either during infusion or following completion of infusion (and can even occur days later). • In gynecologic oncology treatment, drugs that more commonly cause adverse reactions include carboplatin, cisplatin, docetaxel, liposomal doxorubicin, oxaliplatin, and paclitaxel.1 Adverse reactions associated with biotherapeutic agents and taxane drugs (ie, docetaxel, paclitaxel) tend to be infusionrelated and, in taxanes, are often attributed to the excipient (ie, Cremophor EL in paclitaxel, polysorbate 80 in docetaxel). These tend to occur during the first few cycles of treatment (although they can be seen during any infusion regardless of how many previous cycles were administered). Adverse reactions associated with platinum drugs (ie, carboplatin, cisplatin), a true allergy, tend to occur following re-exposure to the inciting drug or less commonly at the completion of initial chemotherapy (ie, cycle 6 of a planned 6 treatments).3

• Preparation for a possible drug reaction Patients and their families should be counseled about the
possibility of a drug reaction and the signs and symptoms of one. Patients should be told to report any signs and symptoms of a drug reaction, especially after they have left the clinic (ie, delayed rash). Clinicians and nursing staff should be prepared for the possibility of a drug reaction every time a patient is infused with a drug. Standing orders should be written for immediate intervention in case a severe drug reaction occurs and the treatment area should have appropriate medical equipment in case of a life-threatening reaction.5 Epinephrine (intramuscular [IM] 0.3 mL of 1 mg/mL solution/ Epipen) should be used for any patient experiencing hypotension (systolic blood pressure of <90 mm Hg) with or without other symptoms of an allergic/hypersensitivity reaction during or shortly after any chemotherapy drug treatment. In the setting of acute cardiopulmonary arrest, standard resuscitation (advanced cardiovascular life support [ACLS]) procedures should be followed. • Desensitization refers to a process of rendering the patient less likely to react in response to an allergen and can be considered an option for patients who have had drug reactions.1,7-10 • If a patient has previously had a very severe life-threatening reaction, the implicated drug should not be used again unless under guidance of an allergist or specialist with desensitization experience.

MANAGEMENT OF DRUG REACTIONS

Infusion Reactions • Symptoms include: hot flushing, rash, fever, chest
tightness, mild blood pressure changes, back pain, and chills. • Symptoms usually can be treated by decreasing the infusion rate and resolve quickly after stopping the infusion. However, patients who have had mild reactions to carboplatin, cisplatin, or oxaliplatin may develop more serious reactions even when the platinum drug is slowly infused; therefore, consider consultation with an allergist.11 • Infusion reactions are more common with paclitaxel (27% of patients); however, mild reactions can occur with liposomal doxorubicin.11 • If an infusion reaction has previously occurred in response to a taxane: For mild infusion reactions (eg, flushing, rash, chills),
patients may be rechallenged with the taxane if: 1) the patient, physician, and nursing staff are all
comfortable with this plan; 2) the patient has been counseled appropriately; and 3) emergency equipment is available in the clinic area. Typically the taxane infusion can be restarted at a much slower rate, and the rate can be slowly increased as tolerated as per the treating clinician’s judgment.7,12 Note that this slow infusion is different from desensitization. Many institutions have nursing policies that stipulate how to reinfuse the drug if the patient has had a prior infusion reaction.

Allergic Reactions (ie, True Drug Allergies) • Symptoms include: rash, edema, shortness of breath (bronchospasm), syncope
or pre-syncope, chest pain, tachycardia, hives/itching, changes in blood pressure, nausea, vomiting, chills, changes in bowel function, and occasionally feeling of impending doom. • Symptoms may continue to persist after stopping infusion and/or after treatment interventions. • Allergic reactions are more common with platinum drugs such as carboplatin (16% of patients), cisplatin, and oxaliplatin.12 Mild reactions can occur with platinum agents.12 • Patients who are at higher risk of developing a hypersensitivity (allergic) reaction include those in the following settings: Re-introduction of the drug after a period of no exposure and following
multiple cycles of the drug during the first and subsequent exposures IV administration of the drug rather than oral or IP administration Those with allergies to other drugs Those who have previously had a reaction • If an allergic reaction has previously occurred: Consider consultation with an allergist (or qualified medical or gynecologic
oncologist) and skin testing for patients who have experienced a platinum reaction (eg, carboplatin-hypersensitivity reaction).12-14 Patients who have had mild reactions may develop more serious reactions even when the platinum drug is slowly infused.12 For more severe or life-threatening reactions—such as those involving blood pressure changes, dyspnea, tachycardia, widespread urticaria, anaphylaxis, or hypoxia—the implicated drug should not be used again unless under guidance of a specialist with desensitization experience. If it is appropriate to give the drug again, patients should be desensitized prior to resuming chemotherapy even if the symptoms have resolved. Patients must be desensitized with each infusion if they previously had a drug reaction.1,7-10

DRUG REACTION TO PLATINUM AGENTS

REACTION

Mild reactiona (hot flushing, rash, pruritus)

MANAGEMENT OF DRUG REACTIONS MANAGEMENT/TREATMENTc

First exposure (platinum naive)

• Decrease the infusion rate Symptoms often resolve
quickly after stopping infusion • Administer H1 blocker
antihistaminec

Second or further exposure

• Stop infusion • Administer H1 blocker
antihistaminec to treat symptoms • Corticosteroid ± IM epinephrined if
symptoms do not quickly resolve

IV or IP drug reaction to platinum agents

Severe reactionb (shortness of breath, changes in blood pressure requiring treatment, dyspnea, GI symptoms [nausea, vomiting])

• Consider allergy consultatione • If staff agree and vital signs remain stable,
rechallenge with platinum drug Administer premedication with H1 blocker
antihistamine, corticosteroids, H2 blockersc • Consider allergy consultation • Do not rechallenge/readminister drug
until evaluated by a specialist with desensitization expertise • Potential candidate for desensitizationf,1 with each infusion
OV-D, 5 of 7

Life-threatening reactionb (ie, anaphylaxis) (acute onset, generalized hives, respiratory compromise, severe hypotension, GI symptoms [nausea, vomiting])
a Most mild reactions are infusion reactions and more commonly are caused by taxanes (ie, docetaxel, paclitaxel), but can also occur with platinum agents (ie, carboplatin, cisplatin).
b Most severe reactions are allergic reactions and more commonly are caused by platinum agents.
c H1 blocker antihistamine (eg, diphenhydramine, hydroxyzine); H2 blockers (eg, cimetidine, famotidine); corticosteroids (eg, methylprednisolone, hydrocortisone, dexamethasone).
d In the setting of acute cardiopulmonary arrest, standard resuscitation (ACLS) procedures should be followed.

OV-D, 5 of 7
Drug Reaction to Taxane, Liposomal Doxorubicin, or Biotherapeutic Agents (OV-D, 6 of 7) e Mild reactions can progress to severe reactions by re-exposure. An allergy consultation may provide skin testing and evaluate sensitization and the risk for further, more severe reactions. f Referral to an academic center with expertise in desensitization is preferred. 1 Castells MC, Tennant NM, Sloane DE, et al.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2024 Ovarian Cancer

Overview
Ovarian neoplasms consist of several histopathologic entities, with epithelial ovarian cancer accounting for the majority of malignant ovarian neoplasms (about 90%).1-4 Epithelial ovarian cancer is the leading cause of death from gynecologic cancer in the United States and is the country’s fifth most common cause of cancer mortality in females.5 In 2022 it is estimated that 19,880 new diagnoses and 12,810 deaths from this malignancy will occur in the United States.5 Five-year survival is about 49%, although survival is longer for select patients with early stage disease and certain histological subtypes.5-8 Approximately half of patients present with distant disease; however, certain uncommon subtypes, such as clear cell and endometrioid cancer, are more likely to be diagnosed at earlier stages.5-7,9

A 5% rule (omitting clinical scenarios that comprise less than 5% of all cases) was used to eliminate uncommon clinical occurrences or conditions from these guidelines.

These NCCN Guidelines for Ovarian Cancer discuss cancers originating in the ovary, fallopian tube, or peritoneum and include recommendations for epithelial subtypes, including serous, endometrioid, carcinosarcoma (malignant mixed Müllerian tumors [MMMTs] of the ovary), clear cell, mucinous, and borderline epithelial tumors (also known as low malignant potential [LMP] tumors). The recommendations are primarily based on data from patients with the most common subtypes—high-grade serous and grade 2 and 3 endometrioid carcinoma. Also included in the guidelines are recommendations for less common ovarian cancers (LCOC), specifically carcinosarcoma, clear cell carcinoma, mucinous carcinoma, low-grade serous carcinoma, grade 1 endometrioid carcinoma, borderline epithelial tumors, and non-epithelial subtypes including malignant sex cord-stromal tumors and germ cell tumors.

By definition, the NCCN Guidelines cannot incorporate all possible clinical variations and are not intended to replace good clinical judgment or individualization of treatments. Exceptions to the rule were discussed among panel members during the process of developing these guidelines.

Literature Search Criteria and Guidelines Update Methodology
Prior to the update of this version of the NCCN Guidelines for Ovarian Cancer, an electronic search of the PubMed database was performed to obtain key literature in ovarian cancer published since the previous Guidelines update, using the following search terms: ((ovarian OR fallopian OR (primary and peritoneal) OR ovary OR (sex and cord-stromal) or mullerian) AND (carcinoma OR cancer OR malignancy OR malignancies OR lesion OR tumor). The PubMed database was chosen because it remains the most widely used resource for medical literature and indexes peer-reviewed biomedical literature.10 The search results were narrowed by selecting studies in humans published in English. Articles were also excluded if they: 1) involved investigational agents that have not yet received FDA approval; 2) did not pertain to the disease site; 3) were clinical trial protocols; or 4) were reviews that were not systematic reviews. The search results were further narrowed by selecting publications reporting clinical data, meta-analyses and systematic reviews of clinical studies, and treatment guidelines developed by other organizations.
The potential relevance of the PubMed search results was examined by the oncology scientist and panel chairs, and a list of selected articles was sent to the panel for their review and discussion at the panel meeting. The panel also reviewed and discussed published materials referenced in Institutional Review Comments or provided with Submission Requests. The data from key PubMed articles, as well as articles from additional sources deemed as relevant to these Guidelines and discussed by the panel, have been included in this version of the Discussion section (eg, e-publications ahead of print, meeting abstracts). Recommendations for which high-level evidence is lacking are based on the panel’s review of lower-level evidence and expert opinion. The complete details of the Development and Update of the NCCN Guidelines are at www.NCCN.org.

Risk Factors for Ovarian Cancer
Reproductive Risk Factors
Epidemiologic studies have identified risk factors in the etiology of ovarian cancer.4,11,12 A 30% to 60% decreased risk for cancer is associated with 1 or more pregnancies/births, the use of oral contraceptives, and/or breastfeeding.11,13-26 Conversely, nulliparity confers an increased risk for ovarian cancer. Data suggest that postmenopausal hormone therapy and pelvic inflammatory disease may increase the risk for ovarian cancer,11,2737 although results vary across studies.38-41 The risk for ovarian borderline epithelial tumors (also known as LMP tumors) may be increased after ovarian stimulation for in vitro fertilization.32,42-46
Obesity, Smoking, and Lifestyle and Environmental Risk Factors
Studies evaluating obesity as a risk factor for ovarian cancer have yielded inconsistent results,47 which may be due to associations between obesity and other ovarian cancer risk factors (eg, parity, oral contraceptive use, menopausal status).23,48,49 The risk associated with obesity may differ across ovarian cancer subtypes, and depend on the timing and reason for weight gain.39,48-50 Smoking is associated with an increased risk for mucinous carcinomas but a decreased risk for clear cell carcinomas.11,51-55 Environmental factors have been investigated, such as talc,56-66 but so far they have not been conclusively associated with the development of this neoplasm.
Family History and Genetic Risk Factors
Family history (primarily patients having two or more first-degree relatives with ovarian cancer)—including linkage with BRCA1 and BRCA2 genotypes (hereditary breast and ovarian cancer [HBOC] syndrome) or families affected by Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer [HNPCC] syndrome)—is associated with increased risk of ovarian cancer, particularly early-onset disease.11,67-88 In addition to mutations in

BRCA1/2 and the genes associated with Lynch syndrome (eg, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2),74,86,87,89-92 germline mutations in a variety of other genes have been associated with increased risk of ovarian cancer (eg, ATM, BRIP1, NBN, PALB2, STK11, RAD51C, RAD51D).73,74,89,92-105 Patients with mutations in BRCA1/2 account for only approximately 15% (range, 7%–21%) of those who have ovarian cancer.73,89,95,106-114 Studies testing large panels of genes have found that 3% to 8% of patients with ovarian cancer carry mutations in genes other than BRCA1 and BRCA2 known to be associated with ovarian cancer susceptibility.73,74,95,108,112,113
Risk-Reducing Surgery for High-Risk Patients
In those at high risk (with either BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations), risk-reducing bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) is associated with a reduced risk for breast, ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers.115-119 Prospective studies have shown that among patients at high risk due to BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation, occult ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer is found in up to 5% of patients undergoing riskreducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO),118,120-125 enabling them to be diagnosed at an earlier and possibly more treatable stage. However, there is a residual risk for primary peritoneal cancer after risk-reducing BSO in individuals at high risk for ovarian cancer.118,121,123,126,127 128Additional considerations and recommended procedures for risk reduction surgery are described in the Risk-Reducing Salpingo-Oophorectomy (RRSO) Protocol section below.
Serous Tubal Intraepithelial Carcinoma (STIC)
It is now generally accepted that the fallopian tube is the origin of many serous ovarian and primary peritoneal cancers, and that serous intraepithelial carcinoma of the fallopian tube (also known as serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma [STIC]) is a precursor of most high-grade serous ovarian or peritoneal cancer.1,127,129-139 A referral to a gynecologic oncologist/comprehensive cancer center is recommended for

management of occult STIC. At present, management options consist of: 1) observation alone with or without CA-125 testing when no evidence of invasive cancer is noted; and 2) surgical staging with observation or chemotherapy based on NCCN Guidelines if invasive cancer is noted. For those without prior genetic counseling and/or testing, discovery of a STIC should prompt a genetics evaluation. Nonetheless, it is not clear whether surgical staging and/or adjuvant chemotherapy is beneficial for those with STIC. An ongoing clinical trial (NCT04251052) sponsored by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) will prospectively track the incidence of STIC lesions as well as outcomes in those with pathogenic variants of BRCA1 that elected to undergo RRSO or risk-reducing salpingectomy with possible delayed oophorectomy.140
Screening
Symptoms of Ovarian Cancer
Because of the location of the ovaries and the biology of most epithelial cancers, it has been difficult to diagnose ovarian cancer at an earlier, more curable stage. Evaluations of patients with newly diagnosed ovarian cancer have resulted in consensus guidelines for ovarian cancer symptoms,139,141-143 which may enable earlier identification of patients who may be at an increased risk of having developed early-stage ovarian cancer.144,145 Symptoms suggestive of ovarian cancer include: bloating, pelvic or abdominal pain, difficulty eating or feeling full quickly, and urinary symptoms (urgency or frequency), especially if these symptoms are new and frequent (>12 d/mo),144 and cannot be attributed to any known (previously identified) malignancy or cause. Physicians evaluating those with this constellation of symptoms must be cognizant of the possibility that ovarian pathology may be causing these symptoms.146,147 Studies testing proposed symptom indices have found that these are not as sensitive or specific as necessary, especially in those with early-stage disease.145,148-154

Screening with Ultrasound and/or Serum CA-125
The literature does not support routine screening for ovarian cancer in the (asymptomatic) general population,155,156 and routine screening is not currently recommended by any professional society.146,147,155,157-164 Several large prospective randomized trials have evaluated screening for ovarian cancer with serum CA-125 and/or ultrasound (US) compared with “usual care” or no screening in the general population of postmenopausal individuals with intact ovaries (Table 1). Primary analysis results and meta analyses of data from these randomized studies suggest that screening may increase the likelihood of diagnosis at an early disease stage,165-167 and may slightly lengthen survival in those diagnosed with ovarian cancer.156,166,168 However, screening did not improve ovarian cancerrelated mortality overall.156,165,167,168 U.S. Preventative Services Task Force assessment of these randomized trials concluded that in average-risk individuals aged 45 years or older, ovarian cancer-related mortality was not improved by annual screening with transvaginal US (TVUS) alone, CA125 alone, or both.159 Results from these randomized prospective trials and from single-arm prospective trials suggest that the positive predictive value was low (<50%) for the screening methods tested (serum CA-125

and/or US).169-172 Harms of screening included false positives in up to 44% of patients (over the course of multiple rounds of screening), which may have caused unnecessary stress and resulted in unnecessary surgery in up to 3.2%, with complications in up to 15% of false-positive surgeries.155,159,165,173-175 A number of analyses have aimed to determine methods to improve the utility of US- and CA-125 based screening in postmenopausal individuals at average risk.166,172,176-188 Several have found that compared with a single CA-125 serum concentration threshold for further testing/surgery, using the risk of ovarian cancer algorithm (ROCA) to determine CA-125–based thresholds may enable earlier detection of ovarian cancer and improve the sensitivity of CA-125–based screening.166,176,178 In the UKCTOCS trial, ROCA was used prospectively in the multimodality screening arm as criteria for further testing (CA-125 at 3 months and/or TVUS), but nonetheless ovarian cancer-related mortality was not significantly different from the unscreened population.165 Data from large population-based studies have shown that a variety of other conditions not related to cancer may impact CA-125 levels,189 which may explain the poor positive predictive value of CA-125 screening observed in prospective trials.

For those with high-risk factors (eg, BRCA mutations, family history of breast or ovarian cancer), RRSO is generally preferred over screening as it reduces the likelihood of breast, ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers.115-119 For those who choose to defer or decline RRSO, some physicians use CA-125 monitoring and endovaginal US.120,157,158,162 Strong supportive evidence for this approach is lacking, however, as several large prospective studies in high-risk patients have shown that these methods have low positive predictive value and do not improve ovarian cancer-related mortality.190-194 However, prospective studies in high-risk patients have also shown that screening with CA-125 and TVUS may improve the likelihood of diagnosis at an earlier stage,190,191,193 and

may improve survival of the patients who develop ovarian cancer.192 As in average-risk patients, analyses of data from high-risk patients suggests that interpretation of CA-125 using ROCA rather than a single concentration threshold improves screen sensitivity and the likelihood of ovarian cancer detection at an earlier stage.190 In high-risk patients the appropriate CA-125 cut-point may depend on menopausal status.195 Recommendations for screening for ovarian cancer in patients with genetic risk factors can be found in the NCCN Guidelines for Genetic/Familial High-Risk Assessment: Breast, Ovarian, and Pancreatic (available at www.NCCN.org).

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2024 Ovarian Cancer

Screening with Other Biomarker Tests
In addition to CA-125, there are a number of biomarkers that have been explored as possible screening tools for early detection of ovarian cancer.181,196-209 Data for most of these proposed biomarkers is limited to retrospective analyses comparing biomarker levels in patients with known ovarian cancer versus healthy controls. Very few biomarkers have been tested prospectively to determine whether they can detect ovarian cancer or predict development of ovarian cancer in those who have no other signs or symptoms of cancer. Data show that several markers (including CA-125, HE4, mesothelin, B7-H4, decoy receptor 3 [DcR3], and spondin-2) do not increase early enough to be useful in detecting early-stage ovarian cancer.182,210,211
There are a number of biomarker tests and prediction algorithms (based on a variety factors, such as symptoms, imaging results, biomarkers, and patient characteristics) that have been developed for assessing the likelihood of malignancy among patients who have an adnexal mass (and have not yet had surgery). It is important to note that these tests are for preoperative assessment only, and none is suitable for ovarian cancer screening prior to detection of an adnexal mass; they are also not for use as stand-alone diagnostic tests. For example, the OVA1 test is a multivariate index assay (MIA) that uses five markers (including transthyretin, apolipoprotein A1, transferrin, beta-2 microglobulin, and CA-125) in preoperative serum to assess the likelihood of malignancy in patients with an adnexal mass for which surgery is planned, with the aim of helping community practitioners determine which patients to refer to a gynecologic oncologist for evaluation and surgery.212-216 The Society of Gynecologic Oncology (SGO) and the FDA have stated that the OVA1 test should not be used as a screening tool to detect ovarian cancer in patients without any other signs of cancer, or as a stand-alone diagnostic tool.146,161,217 Moreover, based on data documenting an increased survival, the NCCN Guidelines Panel recommends that all patients with suspected

ovarian malignancies (especially those with an adnexal mass) should undergo evaluation by an experienced gynecologic oncologist prior to surgery.147,218-221 For discussion of preoperative tests recommended by NCCN for patients with an undiagnosed adnexal mass, see the section below entitled Recommended Workup, Patients Presenting with Clinical Symptoms/Signs.
Risk-Reducing Salpingo Oophorectomy (RRSO) Protocol
The RRSO protocol is recommended for patients at risk for HBOC and is described in detail in the algorithm (see the Principles of Surgery in the algorithm). Selection of patients appropriate for this procedure is described in the NCCN Guidelines for Genetic/Familial High-Risk Assessment: Breast, Ovarian, and Pancreatic (available at www.NCCN.org). In addition to reducing the risk of breast, ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers in patients at high risk,115-119 RRSO can also result in early diagnosis of gynecologic cancer. Occult ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancer is sometimes found by RRSO (in 3.5%–4.6% of patients with BRCA1/2 mutations),118,120-125 and in some cases only detected by pathologic examination of specimens.120,222-227 This emphasizes the need for well-tested protocols that include careful pathologic review of the ovaries and tubes.123,128
This protocol recommends minimally invasive laparoscopic surgery. This procedure should include a survey of the upper abdomen, bowel surfaces, omentum, appendix (if present), and pelvic organs. Any abnormal peritoneal findings should be biopsied. Pelvic washing for cytology should be obtained, using approximately 55 cc normal saline instilled and aspirated immediately. The procedure should include total BSO, removing 2 cm of proximal ovarian vasculature or IP ligament, all of the fallopian tube up to the cornua, and all of the peritoneum surrounding the ovaries and fallopian tubes, especially the peritoneum underlying areas of adhesion between the fallopian tube and/or ovary and the pelvic

sidewall.123 It is recommended to engage in minimal instrument handling of the tubes and ovaries to avoid traumatic exfoliation of cells.123 Both ovaries and tubes should be placed in an endobag for retrieval from the pelvis. Complete evaluation of the fallopian tubes is important, as prospective studies have found that roughly a half of the cases of occult disease identified by RRSO in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers were tubal neoplasms.118,120,122-124 For pathologic assessment, fallopian tubes should be processed by sectioning and extensively examining the fimbriated end (SEE-Fim) of the tubes and then assessed to determine whether any evidence of cancer is present.128,228,229 The ovaries should also be carefully sectioned, processed, and assessed.128 The CAP protocol describes the process for sectioning the fallopian tubes and ovaries.230-232 If occult malignancy or STIC is identified, the patient should be referred to a gynecologic oncologist.
Note that it is controversial whether a hysterectomy should also be done in patients undergoing RRSO. Some patients with elevated risk of ovarian cancer due to genetic risk factors or family history may also have elevated risk of endometrial cancer.233-237 The relationship between BRCA mutations and uterine cancer has been evaluated in multiple studies, with some studies showing that BRCA mutation carriers are at higher risk of uterine/endometrial cancer compared with the general population or compared with those without BRCA mutations;238-242 other studies showing no linkage243,244 or a lower risk of uterine cancer among BRCA mutation carriers;245 and some studies suggesting that increased risk is largely due to tamoxifen exposure.240,246 In a few studies of BRCA mutation carriers who underwent RRSO without hysterectomy and had no evidence of disease at the time of surgery, the post-surgery incidence of uterine cancer was higher compared with the general population,247-249 but in other studies it was not elevated.250 Several studies found that BRCA1 mutations were linked to endometrial or uterine cancer, but BRCA2 mutations either were not associated with increased risk or were not

analyzed.240-242,247-249 However, there are also studies showing no significant association between uterine cancer and BRCA1 mutations,243,245 so further research on this topic is needed.
Certain pathogenic variants associated with Lynch syndrome have been linked to increased risk of endometrial and ovarian cancers, and associated with cases where both types of cancer develop in an individual patient or family.83,86-88,90,251-255 Certain reproductive factors, such as infertility, parity, and exposure to contraceptives, fertility drugs, and postmenopausal hormone therapy, are known to increase or decrease the risk of both ovarian and endometrial cancers.15,16,19,30,45,256-258 Among patients with who underwent RRSO due to BRCA mutation, diagnosis of breast cancer, or family history of breast/ovarian cancer, and elected to have hysterectomy at the time of RRSO, several studies reported finding occult uterine disease, although the frequency varied.120,259-262 Based on studies specifically focusing on patients with mutations associated with Lynch syndrome, however, discovery of occult endometrial cancer may be as frequent as occult ovarian/fallopian tube lesions, and the incidence of endometrial cancer may be significantly reduced by prophylactic hysterectomy.263,264 One large population-based study of individuals with premenopausal primary breast cancer showed that prophylactic BSO plus hysterectomy reduced the risk of new primary breast cancer and improved breast-cancer associated mortality; neither procedure alone significantly modified these risks, and the effect was not seen in those with postmenopausal breast cancer.265 See the NCCN Guidelines for Genetic/Familial High-Risk Assessment: Breast, Ovarian, and Pancreatic (available at www.NCCN.org) for further discussion of selection of patients who may benefit from hysterectomy at the time of RRSO.
The prevention benefits of salpingectomy alone are not yet proven.266-276 If salpingectomy alone is considered, the fallopian tube from the fimbria to its insertion into the uterus should be removed; the fallopian tubes should

also be carefully processed and assessed as described above for BSO.123,128 The concern for risk-reducing salpingectomy alone is that the individuals are still at risk for developing ovarian cancer. In addition, in premenopausal individuals, oophorectomy reduces the risk of developing breast cancer but the magnitude is uncertain.277 For further discussion of residual risks of cancer, see the NCCN Guidelines for Genetic/Familial High-Risk Assessment: Breast, Ovarian, and Pancreatic (available at www.NCCN.org).
The risks of surgery include injury to the bowel, bladder, ureter, and vessels.122,261,278-280 For both patients who are premenopausal and those who are postmenopausal at time of RRSO, menopause symptoms may emerge, re-emerge, or worsen.281-287 RRSO may also have long-term impacts on sexual functioning and quality of life (QOL).281,282,285,286,288-297 Although the existing limited data suggest that management with hormone replacement therapy (HRT) likely does not increase risk of breast cancer in BRCA mutation carriers undergoing RRSO,288,298-303 the efficacy of HRT for symptom management in this population is debated.281-285,293,294,296,300302 RRSO in premenopausal individuals increases risk of certain cardiovascular conditions (eg, coronary heart disease, cardiac arrhythmias, hyperlipidemia), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, arthritis, asthma, osteoporosis, and mental health conditions (cognitive dysfunction, depression, anxiety).284,304-310
Recommended Workup
Patients with ovarian cancer may present in several different ways. Some present with clinical signs and/or symptoms, which upon imaging reveal a pelvic mass and potentially evidence of metastasis. For other patients, ovarian cancer is an incidental finding during a surgery or other procedure. Recommended workup for each of these presentations is described below.

Patients Presenting with Clinical Symptoms/Signs
Clinical symptoms that warrant further workup for possible ovarian cancer include suspicious/palpable pelvic mass found on an abdominal/pelvic exam, ascites, abdominal distention, and/or symptoms (ie, bloating, pelvic/abdominal pain, difficulty eating for feeling full quickly, and urinary symptoms, such as increased urgency or frequency).144 Clinical signs might include abdominal distension/ascites and a mass noted on abdominal/pelvic examination. Further workup for these patients should include imaging, laboratory studies, evaluation of nutritional status, GI evaluation if indicated, and family history. Each of these elements of workup is described in greater detail below.
Imaging The primary workup for patients with clinical signs or symptoms of ovarian cancer should include an abdominal/pelvic US and/or abdominal/pelvic CT/MRI scan. US is typically used for initial evaluation, as it has been shown to be effective at triaging the majority of adnexal masses into benign or malignant categories.311-313 Other imaging modalities may be helpful when the results of US are indeterminate (ie, either the organ of origin or malignant potential is unclear), and may improve assessment of metastases, staging, and preoperative planning.311,313,314 Abdominal/pelvic MRI may be useful for determining malignant potential of adnexal masses if US is not reliable or results are indeterminate.311-313,315-319 FDG-PET/CT scan may also be useful for indeterminate lesions.320-322 The NCCN Panel recommends PET/CT or MRI for indeterminate lesions if they will alter management.
Various imaging methods and algorithms for evaluating imaging results have been proposed for preoperatively distinguishing benign from malignant adnexal masses, with the goal of determining which patients should have surgery and/or be referred to a gynecologic oncologist for further evaluation and surgery. Multiple US-based imaging algorithms for

predicting malignancy have been developed and tested prospective studies comparing preoperative US results to final diagnosis after surgery.323-327 The most thoroughly tested of these are the International Ovarian Tumor Analysis (IOTA) Simple Rules algorithm, based on five US features;188,328-337 and the IOTA logistic regression model (LR2), which combines five US variables with age.186,338-341 A variety of MRI-based approaches for distinguishing benign from malignant masses have been explored in prospective trials comparing preoperative MRI results to final postoperative diagnosis, although these approaches have been less thoroughly tested than the US techniques. Examples include proton MR spectroscopy,342 diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI),343-345 apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps,346 3.0 Tesla (3T) MRI,347 and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI.348 Although both US and MRI are recommended options for preoperative imaging, the NCCN Guidelines are silent regarding the exact techniques used for each, and do not endorse any specific model for preoperative triage.
For assessment of abdominopelvic metastases for preoperative staging, estimation of resectability, and surgical planning, abdominal/pelvic CT or MRI are generally more useful than US.314,315,318,349-351 Although CT is preferred in some circles, MRI has been shown to provide equivalent accuracy for staging and comparable accuracy for predicting peritoneal tumor volume, and can be useful if CT results are inconclusive.314 For assessing advanced disease, FDG-PET/CT may also be useful if CT results are indeterminate, and has been shown to have higher accuracy than CT for detection of metastases.314,321,352-355
Although there is no direct evidence that chest x-ray or chest CT is necessary, panel members felt that it should be part of the overall evaluation of a patient before surgical staging if clinically indicated. CT of the chest can detect pleural or pulmonary metastases, as well as pleural

effusion, which may help with treatment planning.314 All CT/MRI imaging should be performed with contrast unless contraindicated.
Laboratory Studies and Biomarker Tests Appropriate laboratory studies for patients presenting with clinical symptoms/signs of ovarian cancer include CBC and chemistry profile with liver function test.
A number of specific biomarkers and algorithms using multiple biomarker test results have been proposed for preoperatively distinguishing benign from malignant tumors in patients who have an undiagnosed adnexal/pelvic mass. Biomarker tests developed and evaluated in prospective trials comparing preoperative serum levels to postoperative final diagnosis include serum HE4 and CA-125, either alone or combined using the Risk of Ovarian Malignancy Algorithm [ROMA] algorithm;185,187,356-371 the MIA (brand name OVA1) based on serum levels of five markers: transthyretin, apolipoprotein A1, transferrin, beta-2 microglobulin, and CA-125154,212-216,372; and the second-generation MIA (MIA2G, branded name OVERA) based on CA-125, transferrin, apolipoprotein A1, follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH], and HE4.184,373 The FDA has approved the use of ROMA, OVA1, or OVERA for estimating the risk for ovarian cancer in those with an adnexal mass for which surgery is planned, and have not yet been referred to an oncologist.217,374,375 Although the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) has suggested that ROMA and OVA1 may be useful for deciding which patients to refer to a gynecologic oncologist,376 other professional organizations have been non-committal.161,312,377 Not all studies have found that multi-biomarker assays improve all metrics (ie, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value) for prediction of malignancy compared with other methods (eg, imaging, single-biomarker tests, symptom index/clinical assessment).185,215,357,378-380 Currently, the NCCN Panel does not recommend the use of these

biomarker tests for determining the status of an undiagnosed adnexal/pelvic mass.
Nonetheless, the NCCN Guidelines do include CA-125 testing as a possible element of preoperative workup, if clinically indicated. This recommendation is based on data showing that serum CA-125 levels correlate with extent of disease, and may have prognostic value, so may help in treatment planning.381-385 Serum CA-125 levels tend to correlate with the clinical course of disease, especially in those with elevated pretreatment levels, so can be useful for monitoring response to therapy and surveillance for recurrence.4,382,384-396
Some evidence suggests that HE4 may be a useful prognostic marker in patients with ovarian cancer, decreases during response to treatment, and may improve early detection of recurrence relative to CA-125 alone.397-424 NCCN Panel members sometimes test HE4 in patients who do not have elevated CA-125, as HE4 can be useful for future monitoring in such patients. However, because results vary across studies,425-427 the NCCN Guidelines currently do not recommend routine HE4 as part of preoperative workup.
In addition to CA-125, the NCCN Guidelines mention that other tumor markers may be used as part of preoperative workup, if clinically indicated: inhibin, alpha-fetoprotein [AFP], beta–human chorionic gonadotropin [beta-hCG], lactate dehydrogenase [LDH], carcinoembryonic antigen [CEA], and CA19-9. Serum levels of these markers can be elevated in patients with certain LCOCs, and correlate with disease course in some of these patients. Measurement of these markers prior to surgery can help to assess for LCOC (see Less Common Ovarian Cancers), and facilitate future monitoring during surveillance after treatment, especially in patients who do not have elevated serum CA-125 at baseline and/or have tumor types in which CA-125 level is less likely to be informative.395

For example, AFP, beta-hCG, and LDH are markers for malignant germ cell tumors that can be helpful in intraoperative diagnosis, preoperative planning, and post-treatment monitoring for recurrence.376,395,428-436 AFP can be produced by endodermal sinus (yolk sac) tumors, embryonal carcinomas, polyembryomas, and immature teratomas; beta-hCG can be produced by choriocarcinomas, embryonal carcinomas, polyembryomas, and, in low levels, in some dysgerminomas; and LDH can be a marker for dysgerminoma.428,429 Some studies in young patients presenting with an ovarian mass have found that high levels of AFP and beta-hCG were correlated with higher likelihood of malignancy,436,437 or linked to specific subtypes,431,438,439 suggesting that these markers may help with intraoperative diagnosis to determine whether fertility-sparing surgery is an option. High serum AFP levels and poor decline in serum AFP levels after treatment appear to be associated with worse outcomes in patients with germ cell tumors.432,438-443 High serum beta-CG may also be correlated with poorer prognosis.432,444 High levels of serum LDH have been correlated with more extensive disease and poor outcomes in some patients with ovarian germ cell tumors.443,445-447 If a patient with a germ cell tumor or sex chord stromal tumor has elevated levels of one or more of these markers at baseline, and levels decline after treatment, then the marker(s) is more likely to be useful for follow-up for recurrence.448 AFP and hCG are commonly used to monitor for recurrence in patients with germ cell tumors (GCTs), and have included clinical trials for detection of recurrence.448-451
Sex cord-stromal tumors of the ovary, particularly granulosa cell tumors, can produce inhibin, and inhibin expression level in tumor tissue and serum have been proposed as diagnostic markers.395,452-461 Some studies have shown that serum levels of inhibin A and B, particularly inhibin B, correlate with extent of disease in patients with granulosa cell tumors, decreasing during treatment and then increasing again prior to relapse, leading to the proposal that serum inhibin monitoring may be helpful for

long-term follow-up.462-467 In some cases of ovarian stromal tumor inhibin levels are not elevated, however, so this marker is not useful for monitoring response to treatment.468
Elevated serum CEA is a marker associated with gastrointestinal (GI) primary cancers, but can also occur in patients with ovarian malignancies, particularly mucinous tumors.4,469-477 Because of its association with GI cancers, some advocate for further GI imaging in patients with high serum CEA.142,469 A ratio of serum CA-125 to CEA >25 has been proposed for differentiating ovarian cancer from colorectal cancer,478,479 particularly for confirming ovarian cancer diagnosis in patients considering neoadjuvant therapy (and biopsy results are not available).469,480 CA-125:CEA ratio has been incorporated into entry criteria in trials testing neoadjuvant therapies.481-483 For patients with mucinous ovarian cancer, it has been proposed that CEA may be useful for monitoring for recurrent disease.146,476,484 CA19-9 is another marker that is elevated more often in mucinous tumors compared with other ovarian cancer types.477,485-492 Results from some studies suggest that serum CA19-9 may be useful for monitoring for recurrence, especially in patients with mucinous ovarian cancers, and in those with high CA19-9 levels prior to treatment.395,488,493,494
Evaluation of Nutritional Status and Gastrointestinal (GI) Evaluation Workup should also include evaluation of the patient’s nutritional status, and GI evaluation if clinically indicated. Patients with ovarian cancer often present with bloating, pelvic or abdominal pain, difficulty eating, or feeling full quickly,144 which can lead to changes in dietary habits that result in poor nutritional status. Poor nutritional status has been linked to higher risk of suboptimal surgery, surgical complications, and poor survival, especially in older patients.495-501 There are a variety of ways to assess nutritional status, including body weight, body mass index, anthropometrics, serum protein, serum albumin, transferrin, lymphocyte

count, bioelectrical impedance analysis, and body composition measures (adipose and lean tissues, skeletal muscle index).495-498,500,502-516 Two commonly used metrics are the prognostic nutritional index (PNI) and subjective global assessment (SGA).496,504,517-523 Evaluation of nutritional status is recommended as part of baseline workup as it is important for determining whether a patient is a good surgical candidate, and for preoperative planning.480,524 For those who are not good surgical candidates, NACT may be a better option versus upfront debulking surgery. However, poor nutritional status in the context of a GI mass may be an indication for prioritizing surgery to remove or reduce the GI mass,525,526 especially if the patient is otherwise a relatively fit surgical candidate.
Given that GI cancers and primary mucinous carcinoma of the ovary can both cause serum CEA elevation,4,469-477 and can both present with adnexal masses, GI tract evaluation is especially important in these patients to determine whether patients have metastases to the ovary or primary mucinous carcinoma of the ovary (see Mucinous Carcinomas).527 The presence of a pancreatic mass or widespread abdominal disease should also increase suspicion for primary GI cancer.
Family History and Genetic Testing Obtaining a family history and referral to a genetic counselor is an important part of workup, as some patients may have hereditary traits that may inform future treatment and determine whether family members should be screened. Primary treatment (surgery and chemotherapy) should not be delayed for a genetic counselling referral, however, as genetic test results are not needed for selection of primary surgery and/or chemotherapy, and delay in treatment is associated with poorer outcomes.528,529 Recommendations regarding genetic testing can be found in the NCCN Guidelines for Genetic/Familial High-Risk Assessment: Breast, Ovarian, and Pancreatic and the NCCN Guidelines for

Genetic/Familial High-Risk Assessment: Colorectal (available at www.NCCN.org).
Although germline and/or somatic BRCA1 and BRCA2 status may inform future options for maintenance therapy, BRCA testing for the purpose of informing treatment is not needed until after there is histologic confirmation of ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer (eg, after primary surgery or confirmation by biopsy). See Molecular Testing section below.
Prediction of Malignancy, Referral to a Gynecologic Oncologist There are a number of prediction algorithms that combine multiple factors, such as symptoms, imaging results, biomarkers, and patient characteristics, to predict the likelihood of malignancy among patients who have an undiagnosed adnexal mass (ie, a mass detected by clinical exam or imaging that has not yet been resected and definitively diagnosed by pathology).316,338,351,371,530 These algorithms were developed with the goal of reducing the number and/or extent of unnecessary surgeries by using the likelihood of malignancy to determine which patients are most likely to benefit from surgery, and/or identify cases to be referred to a gynecologic oncologist for further testing and surgery. Many of these algorithms have been tested in prospective trials comparing preoperative prediction to postoperative histologically confirmed diagnosis, including IOTA Assessment of Different NEoplasias in the adneXa (ADNEX), which uses patient age, type of center (oncology referral vs other), serum CA-125, and six US variables;316,330,531,532 Risk of Malignancy Indexes (RMI-1 through 4), which use US features, patient menopausal status, and serum CA125;339,358,359,533-539 combining symptom index (SI) with CA-125 and HE4 results;153 and the (early) ACOG/SGO referral guidelines based on patient age, CA-125 level, physical findings, imaging results, and family history.351,371,540 Several prospective studies have compared multiple algorithms or algorithms versus other metrics to determine which most accurately predicts malignancy.212,214,215,338,357-359,378,379

Currently the NCCN Guidelines do not endorse any of these methods. Because primary assessment and debulking by a gynecologic oncologist is associated with improved survival, all patients with lesions suspected to be ovarian malignancies (based on clinical evidence) should be referred to an experienced gynecologic oncologist for evaluation—both to assess suitability for different primary surgical options and to select the best method for obtaining the material needed for definitive diagnosis.147,218-221 A gynecologic oncologist should be involved in assessing whether a patient is a suitable surgical candidate and/or an appropriate candidate for neoadjuvant therapy, and consideration of laparoscopic evaluation to determine feasibility of debulking surgery. A gynecologic oncologist should also be consulted for management of occult STICs.
Workup for Patients Referred with Diagnosis by Previous Surgery
Patients are on occasion referred to NCCN Member Institutions after having a previous diagnosis of ovarian cancer by surgery or tissue biopsy (cytopathology). At times, patients with newly diagnosed ovarian cancer have had cytoreductive surgery and comprehensive staging procedures (ie, having met the standards for surgical staging of the Gynecologic Oncology Group [GOG]).541 In some instances, referral occurs after incomplete surgery and/or staging (eg, uterus and/or adnexa intact, omentum not removed, incomplete lymph node dissection, residual disease that is potentially resectable, surgical stage not completely documented, occult invasive carcinoma found at time of risk reduction surgery). The components of surgical staging are listed in the algorithm (see Principles of Surgery in the algorithm).
Workup procedures are very similar for patients having undiagnosed or diagnosed pelvic masses at the time of referral. In these cases, evaluation by a gynecologic oncologist is important for determining whether the previous surgery was adequate or an additional surgery is needed. Prior imaging studies and operative notes should be reviewed to determine

additional workup needed and to inform treatment approach. Additional imaging may be needed to screen for distant disease and evaluate for residual disease not removed during the previous surgery. Imaging options include chest/abdominal/pelvic CT or MRI, PET/CT, and/or US. All imaging should be performed with contrast unless contraindicated. Pathology review of tissue from the previous surgery is important for confirming diagnosis and cancer type. CBC and chemistry profile with LFTs should be obtained, and CA-125 or other tumor markers should be measured if indicated to corroborate likely diagnosis and to serve as baseline for future follow-up. See section above on Laboratory Studies and Biomarker Tests. If not previously done, workup should include obtaining a family history, genetic risk evaluation, and germline and somatic testing, if not previously done. Recommendations regarding genetic testing can be found in the NCCN Guidelines for Genetic/Familial High-Risk Assessment: Breast, Ovarian, and Pancreatic and the NCCN Guidelines for Genetic/Familial High-Risk Assessment: Colorectal (available at www.NCCN.org). As described in the Molecular Testing section below, germline and/or somatic BRCA1/2 testing informs selection of maintenance therapy (after first-line platinum-based chemotherapy). Molecular analysis of tumor tissue from the previous surgery may be warranted. In the absence of a BRCA1/2 mutation, homologous recombination deficiency status may provide information on the magnitude of benefit of PARP inhibitor maintenance therapy (category 2B).
Diagnosis, Pathology, and Staging
Most ovarian cancers, including the LCOC, are diagnosed after pathologic analysis of a biopsy or surgical specimen, which may occur preoperatively, intraoperatively, or postoperatively. If possible, fine-needle aspiration (FNA) should be avoided for diagnosis of ovarian cancer in patients with presumed early-stage disease to prevent rupturing the cyst and spilling malignant cells into the peritoneal cavity; however, FNA may be necessary in patients who are not candidates for primary debulking, such as those

with bulky disease, older patients, or patients in poor health.542,543 Both primary peritoneal and fallopian tube cancers are usually diagnosed postoperatively (if there is no major involvement of the ovary) or preoperatively (if there is a biopsy and the patient has already had a bilateral oophorectomy). Patients who have equivocal pathologic findings or who are referred to NCCN Member Institutions after having a previous diagnosis of ovarian cancer should have their pathology reviewed by pathologists at NCCN Member Institutions.
Primary peritoneal and fallopian tube cancers are treated in the same manner as epithelial ovarian cancer, so distinguishing these three possible primary sites is less crucial than ruling out other cancers that commonly involve the adnexa, such as uterine, cervical, gastro intestinal (small and large bowel, pancreatic) cancers or lymphoma;544,545 benign ovarian and non-ovarian conditions also need to be ruled out (eg, serous cystadenoma).546 In addition, metastases to the ovaries need to be ruled out (see Mucinous Carcinomas).
The CAP protocol is a useful tool for pathology reports, and has been updated for consistency with the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual, 8th edition.230,547 Based on the CAP protocol (Version 1.1.1.0; Feb 2020)230 and panel consensus, the NCCN Guidelines recommend that pathologic assessment should include the following elements: all tumor site(s) (eg, ovary, fallopian tube, pelvic/abdominal peritoneum, uterus, cervix, omentum); all tumor size(s); for ovarian/fallopian tumors, surface involvement (present/absent/cannot determine), specimen integrity (capsule/serosa intact/fractured/fragmented); histologic type and grade; extension and/or implants (if sampled/identified); cytology results from peritoneal/ascitic fluid/washings and pleural fluid; the number and location of lymph nodes examined, and size of largest lymph node metastatic deposits; and evidence of STIC, endometriosis [particularly if in continuity with endometrioid or clear cell carcinoma], and endosalpingiosis.

that this is a metaplastic carcinoma, with both components arising from an epithelial precursor, and the sarcomatous component resulting from transdifferentiation (epithelial-mesenchymal transition).563-570

Histologic Subtypes

Germ cell tumors are a non-epithelial subtype, and include

Epithelial ovarian cancer has four main subtypes, including serous, endometrioid, mucinous, and clear cell; most patients (about 70%) have serous cancers.3,549-552 Molecular characterization of clear cell, mucinous, or low-grade (grade 1) serous tumors suggests that mutations in these cancer types are different from those in higher grade tumors.553-555 Ovarian cancer can be divided into Types 1 and 2 based on these molecular alterations. Data suggest that serous tumors can be categorized as either low grade (grade 1) or high grade (grade 2 or 3).549,556-561
Ovarian borderline epithelial tumors, also called LMP tumors or atypical proliferative tumors, are another type of primary epithelial lesions. The terms for borderline epithelial tumors have changed over the years, and recent CAP protocols do not use “LMP.”230,562 Borderline tumors have cytologic characteristics suggesting malignancy, and may grossly resemble an invasive cancer, but microscopic evaluation shows no evidence of frank invasion by the tumor nodules, although rarely invasive implants (which continue to be consistent with the diagnosis of borderline epithelial lesions) can be identified microscopically by the pathologist. The characteristic pathologic hallmark of typical epithelial ovarian cancer is the identification of peritoneal implants, which microscopically and/or macroscopically invade the peritoneum. Borderline epithelial tumors are typically serous or mucinous; but other histologic subtypes can also occur (see WHO Histologic Classification in the algorithm).1,230
Carcinosarcomas arising in the ovary, fallopian tubes, or peritoneum, also

dysgerminomas, immature teratomas, embryonal tumors, and endodermal sinus (yolk sac) tumors.1 Malignant sex cord-stromal tumors, another nonepithelial subtype, are rare and include granulosa cell tumors (most common) and Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors.1
In some cases, it can be difficult to distinguish between cancer subtypes. For example, high-grade endometrioid tumors can be difficult to distinguish from high-grade serous tumors.549 Some endometrioid tumors look similar to clear cell tumors, while others may resemble sex cordstromal tumors.549 Immunohistochemistry (IHC) with certain markers may help with differential diagnosis. Whereas most (80%–90%) of serous carcinomas are positive for WT1, endometrioid and clear cell carcinomas are usually negative.562,571,572 Endometrioid adenocarcinomas are usually positive for cytokeratin 7 (CK7), PAX8, CA-125, and estrogen receptors. The presence of endometriosis can sometimes help to distinguish subtypes, as clear cell carcinomas and endometrioid tumors can be associated with endometriosis, whereas other subtypes are less likely to be.562 Endometrioid carcinomas are also very similar in appearance to sex cord-stromal tumors.562 Most clear cell carcinomas express Napsin A, a marker that is specific to this subtype.573 It is difficult to distinguish based on histology between primary mucinous ovarian carcinomas and GI metastases.574-576 PAX8 immunostaining is typical of primary tumors,572 although absence of PAX8 does not rule out ovary as the primary site. SATB2 is consistent with colonic origin.577 Metastatic colorectal adenocarcinomas also usually are positive for CK20 and CEA.

subtypes.6,549,551,552,578,579 In the NCCN Guidelines, most of the recommendations are based on data from patients with the most common subtypes—high-grade serous and grade 2/3 endometrioid. The NCCN Guidelines also include recommendations specifically for patients with less common ovarian cancers (LCOC), which in the Guidelines include the following: carcinosarcoma, clear cell carcinoma, mucinous carcinoma, lowgrade serous, grade 1 endometrioid, borderline epithelial, malignant sex cord-stromal, and malignant germ cell tumors.

A pathology and staging cancer protocol is available from the College of American Pathologists (CAP) for examination of specimens from patients with primary tumors of the ovary, fallopian tube, or peritoneum, including pTNM requirements from the AJCC Staging Manual 8th edition and FIGO Staging.230

Staging
The NCCN Guidelines for Ovarian Cancer reflect the importance of stage and grade of disease on prognosis and treatment recommendations. Ovarian cancer is classified primarily as stages I to IV using the FIGO (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics) staging system, which was approved by the AJCC and incorporated into the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual 8th Edition staging system, which was published in late 2016 and was effective for all cancer cases recorded on or after January 1, 2018 (see Staging section of the algorithm).547,557 More than half of patients present with distant disease, although certain LCOC are more likely to be diagnosed at earlier stages7,9,580 Serous ovarian cancer is now often referred to as either low grade (most grade 1 serous tumors) or high grade (most grade 2 or 3 serous tumors).230,549,556,557,559,560 Pathologists may use histologic grades 1, 2, or 3 for endometrioid carcinomas, mucinous carcinomas, and stage IC tumors.230 Primary peritoneal adenocarcinoma, fallopian tube carcinoma, and LCOC are also staged using the FIGO/AJCC (8th edition) ovarian cancer staging system.547,556,557 Except for select individuals with stage I, grade 1 tumors (in whom survival is greater than 95% after comprehensive laparotomy), patients in all other stages of ovarian cancer are likely to require treatment after surgical staging. All patients with ovarian cancer, particularly those requiring additional treatment, should be encouraged to participate in a relevant clinical trial.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2024 Ovarian Cancer

Molecular Testing
Upon pathologic confirmation of ovarian cancer, fallopian tube cancer, or primary peritoneal cancer, patients should be referred for a genetic risk evaluation and germline and somatic testing (if not previously done). This recommendation for germline and somatic testing is intentionally broad so that the genetic counselor and treating oncologist have the latitude to order whichever molecular tests they consider necessary based on evaluation of the individual patient and their cancer family history. Since germline and/or somatic BRCA1/2 testing informs selection of maintenance therapy for those with stage II–IV disease who are in complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) after first-line platinumbased chemotherapy, NCCN Panel members agree that it is important to establish BRCA1/2 mutation status for patients who may be eligible for maintenance therapy following completion of platinum-based first-line chemotherapy. Homologous recombination status (e.g., homologous recombination deficient [HRD] vs. homologous recombination proficient [HRP]) may provide information on the magnitude of benefit of PARP inhibitor maintenance therapy for those without a BRCA1/2 mutation. For additional recommendations on workup, staging and primary treatment for ovarian cancer, fallopian tube cancer, and primary peritoneal cancer, please refer to OV-1 in the guidelines on http://www.NCCN.org.
With the availability of next-generation sequencing technology, the panel discussed whether comprehensive tumor molecular analysis should be recommended for all patients. Some panel members stated that comprehensive tumor testing may not be necessary for certain patients in the upfront setting, specifically those with a germline mutation in BRCA1/2 or other homologous recombination/DNA repair pathway genes. However, some patients (such as those who lack a BRCA1/2 mutation or experience disease recurrence) may benefit from a more thorough tumor molecular analysis to inform additional targeted therapy options. The panel agreed

that tumor testing may be beneficial at multiple points throughout the evolution of the disease.
Therefore, the current guidelines recommend tumor molecular analysis both in the upfront setting and upon recurrence (OV-B 1 of 3). The goal of tumor testing in the upfront setting is to optimize identification of molecular alterations that can inform the use of interventions with demonstrated benefit in this setting, such as PARP inhibitors. Molecular alterations that should be probed for in this setting include BRCA1/2 status, loss of heterozygosity, or homologous recombination status, in the absence of a germline BRCA mutation.
Other tumor tissue molecular markers may inform selection of treatment for persistent or recurrent disease but testing for these is not needed until the disease has proven to be refractory or at time of relapse. The panel recommends that tumor molecular analysis in the recurrence setting should include, at a minimum, tests to identify potential benefit from targeted therapeutics that have tumor-specific or tumor-agnostic benefit. These include (but are not limited to): BRCA1/2, HR status, microsatellite instability (MSI), mismatch repair (MMR), tumor mutational burden (TMB), BRAF, and NTRK, if prior testing did not include these markers. The panel emphasizes that more comprehensive tumor analysis may be particularly important for less common histologies with limited approved treatment options. Prior to selection of systemic therapy for refractory or recurrent disease, validated tumor molecular testing should be performed in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-approved facility using the most recent available tumor tissue.

Primary Treatment

laparotomy is recommended for most patients, but minimally invasive

Primary treatment for presumed ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer usually consists of appropriate surgical staging and debulking surgery, followed in most (but not all) patients by systemic chemotherapy.13,142,218,581,582 However, for some patients with early-stage disease, surgery alone (followed by observation) may be sufficient as primary treatment. In addition, for certain histologic subtypes, adjuvant therapy with hormonal agents are options that may be considered. NACT with interval debulking surgery (IDS) should be considered in patients with advanced-stage ovarian cancer who are not good candidates for upfront primary debulking surgery (PDS) due to advanced age, frailty, poor performance status, comorbidities, or who have disease unlikely to be optimally cytoreduced.480,583 Emerging data support an increasing role of

techniques may be appropriate in certain circumstances (See Open Laparotomy Versus Minimally Invasive Techniques). Prior to surgery, patients with advanced disease should be counseled about port placement if intraperitoneal (IP) chemotherapy is being considered. Intraoperative pathologic evaluation with frozen sections may assist in management by providing confirmation of diagnosis and cancer type and providing information about the extent of disease. For all procedures, the surgeon should describe the following in the operative report: 1) the extent of initial disease in the pelvis, mid abdomen, and upper abdomen before debulking; 2) whether a complete or incomplete resection was achieved; and 3) if resection was incomplete, the amount and size of residual disease in the aforementioned areas after debulking.587

PARP inhibitors in the management of ovarian cancer.584 In the primary treatment setting, PARP inhibitors have been incorporated as NCCNrecommended maintenance therapy options for select patients after firstline chemotherapy. Each of these primary treatment options, including maintenance therapy options after first-line chemotherapy, are described in more detail below. As described above, for all patients with suspected or confirmed ovarian cancer a gynecologic oncologist should be involved in assessing whether a patient is a suitable surgical candidate and/or an appropriate candidate for neoadjuvant therapy, and consideration of

For most patients presenting with suspected malignant ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal neoplasm, initial surgery should include a hysterectomy (if uterus present) and BSO with comprehensive staging and debulking as indicated.13,588,589 This is the recommended approach for stage IA–IV if optimal cytoreduction appears feasible, the patient is a surgical candidate, and fertility is not a concern. It is described in greater detail below in the section entitled Debulking Surgery for Newly Diagnosed Disease.

staging, primary debulking, interval debulking, or secondary cytoreduction. Laparoscopic Evaluation Prior To Resection

Improvement of minimally invasive methods and selection of appropriate patients are the topics of much study and debate.590-620 Minimally invasive techniques are commonly used for early-stage disease (or presumed early-stage disease), and some studies have shown no difference in surgical outcomes, recurrence rates, or survival for those who received minimally invasive versus open surgical staging.591,593-595,598-600,604,611-614,621625 If signs of lymph node metastasis or localized carcinomatosis are found, lymphadenectomy and complete pelvic peritonectomy may be feasible using minimally invasive techniques.608 The NCCN Guidelines indicate that in early-stage disease, minimally invasive techniques to achieve the surgical goals may be considered in selected patients if performed by an experienced gynecologic oncologist.315,588,601,626,627

In select patients with advanced-stage disease, minimally invasive procedures (assessment laparoscopy) may be used to assess whether optimal cytoreduction is likely to be achieved by PDS, in order to determine whether NACT may be a better initial treatment option.628-639 A randomized trial assessed whether laparoscopy would be useful to predict the ability to achieve optimal cytoreduction (<1 cm residual disease). Optimal cytoreduction was achieved in 90% (92/102) of patients randomized to the assessment laparoscopy arm compared to 61% (60/99) of patients who were randomized to the laparotomy without assessment laparoscopy arm (relative risk [RR], 0.25; 95% CI, 0.13–0.47; P < .001).634 Assessment laparoscopy to evaluate extent of disease and feasibility of resection was used frequently in the large prospective trials validating NACT and IDS and was required in one of these trials (SCORPION).481-

Fertility-Sparing Options for Stage I Disease Fertility preservation is an evolving field and area of active research, with many approaches being explored, and many patient- and case-specific factors to consider, especially for those with malignancies.641-643 Patients who wish to retain fertility options should be referred to a reproductive endocrinologist for preoperative evaluation and consultation. Large retrospective studies and meta-analyses have found that for stage I epithelial ovarian cancer, fertility-sparing surgery did not appear to compromise disease-free survival (DFS) or overall survival (OS) compared with radical surgery.644-653 Although clear cell histology is associated with increased risk of poor outcomes,651 some studies have shown that even among patients with stage I clear cell, fertility-sparing surgery does not increase risk of relapse or shorten survival compared with radical surgery.645,646,649,650,653 Large retrospective studies among patients with stage I borderline ovarian tumors have found that recurrence rate and survival is similar for those treated with fertility-sparing versus radical surgery.654-657 In retrospective studies, including multivariate analyses, fertility-sparing surgery does not appear to be associated with poorer outcomes (DFS, progression-free survival [PFS], OS) compared with more extensive surgery in patients with stage I germ cell tumors and sex cordstromal tumors.658-673 Fertility-sparing surgery may be considered for patients who wish to preserve fertility and have apparent early-stage disease and/or low-risk tumors, such as early-stage invasive epithelial tumors, LMP lesions, malignant germ cell tumors, or malignant sex cordstromal tumors. Even if the contralateral ovary cannot be spared, uterine preservation can be considered as it allows for potential future assisted reproductive approaches. A USO (preserving the uterus and contralateral ovary/fallopian tube) and comprehensive surgical staging may be adequate for select patients who wish to preserve fertility and appear to have stage IA unilateral tumors.674-679 For those with bilateral stage IB tumors who wish to maintain fertility, a BSO (preserving the uterus) and comprehensive surgical staging can be considered. In patients undergoing

USO or BSO, comprehensive surgical staging should still be performed in most patients to rule out occult higher-stage disease, because data show that approximately 30% of patients (with presumed early-stage disease) are upstaged after undergoing complete staging surgery.595,599,600,680-684 Comprehensive surgical staging may be omitted in pediatric/adolescent patients with clinically apparent early-stage malignant germ cell tumors based on the pediatric surgical literature suggesting that incomplete staging does not result in poorer outcomes (OS).685 For adults with apparent stage I malignant ovarian germ cell tumors, comprehensive staging is recommended based on results from retrospective studies suggesting that incomplete surgical staging may be associated with increased risk of recurrence;686,687 although others found no relationship between incomplete staging and DFS.688
Debulking Surgery for Newly Diagnosed Disease Debulking surgery is widely accepted as an important component of initial treatment for patients with clinical stage II, III, or IV disease, and multiple retrospective studies have contributed to the understanding of the extent of debulking needed to achieve maximal cytoreduction.142,218,221,676,680,689-691 Optimal cytoreduction is defined as residual disease less than 1 cm in maximum diameter or thickness;589,676,692-694 however, maximal effort should be made to remove all gross disease since resection to R0 offers superior survival outcomes.689,695 Although debulking surgery is the standard of care, this recommendation is based on retrospective data (and thus is not a category 1 recommendation).694 In general, the procedures described in this section should be part of the surgical management of patients with ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer in an effort to fully stage patients and to achieve maximal debulking preferable to resection of all visible disease in appropriate circumstances and at least to less than 1-cm residual disease if complete cytoreduction is not feasible.696-698 These procedures also apply to many of the LCOC.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2024 Ovarian Cancer

For patients with newly diagnosed epithelial ovarian cancer apparently confined to an ovary or to the pelvis, the goal of surgery is to achieve complete cytoreduction of all pelvic disease and to evaluate for occult disease in the upper abdomen or retroperitoneum. For patients with newly diagnosed invasive epithelial ovarian cancer involving the pelvis and upper abdomen, the goal is to achieve optimal cytoreduction of all abdominal, pelvic, and retroperitoneal disease.
On entering the abdomen, aspiration of ascites or peritoneal lavage should be performed for peritoneal cytologic examinations. For obvious disease beyond the ovaries, cytologic assessment of ascites and/or lavage specimens will not alter stage or management. For patients with disease apparently confined to an ovary or to the pelvis, all peritoneal surfaces should be visualized, and any peritoneal surface or adhesion suspicious for harboring metastasis should be selectively excised or biopsied. In the absence of any suspicious areas, random peritoneal biopsies should be taken from the pelvis, paracolic gutters, and undersurfaces of the diaphragm.

For patients with disease apparently confined to an ovary or to the pelvis (presumed stage I/II), omentectomy should be performed to rule out higher-stage disease. For patients with disease involving the pelvis and upper abdomen (stage III/IV), all involved omentum should be removed.
The use of systematic lymphadenectomy is an area of controversy. For patients with presumed early stage, a randomized trial showed that systematic aortic and pelvic lymphadenectomy improved detection of metastatic nodes compared with node sampling (positive nodes found in 9 vs. 22%; P = .007), but was not associated with improved PFS or OS.705 Operating time and the proportion of patients requiring blood transfusions was significantly higher for those who underwent systematic lymphadenectomy.705 However, meta-analyses that included retrospective or observational studies have reported that systematic lymphadenectomy improves OS in patients with early-stage disease, even though it does not improve PFS.706,707 Similar to this randomized controlled trial, other prospective studies using systematic lymphadenectomy have found 3% to 14% of patients had positive lymph nodes.708-712

Hysterectomy and BSO should be performed. Although hysterectomy is recommended for most patients, USO or BSO with uterine preservation may be considered for selected patients with apparent stage IA/IB disease desiring to preserve fertility (See Fertility-Sparing Options for Stage I Disease). Every effort should be made to keep an encapsulated ovarian mass intact during removal.543,598 For young patients who will abruptly enter menopause after surgery, various supportive care measures may be used to help decrease hot flashes and other symptoms, and potentially reduce the risk of other systemic comorbidities that are more likely with surgical menopause.699-702 HRT has not been shown to worsen survival in premenopausal patients with gynecologic cancers, but limited perspective data exist.703,704

For patients with advanced ovarian cancer, some early prospective studies suggested that systematic lymphadenectomy improved survival.713,714 An early international randomized trial in patients with stage IIIB–IV (optimally debulked) epithelial ovarian cancer found that systematic lymphadenectomy improved PFS compared with resection of bulky nodes only, although OS was not improved, operating times were longer, and more patients required blood transfusions.715 A randomized study of patients with stage IA–IV disease undergoing second look surgery found that although systematic lymphadenectomy increased detection of nodal metastases compared with resection of bulky nodes only (positive nodes found in 24% vs. 13%; P = .02), this did not translate into improved PFS or OS in the whole population or in subpopulations based on stage or extent of resection.716 As in other studies, systematic lymphadenectomy was

associated with longer operating times, more blood loss and transfusions, and longer hospital stays.716 More recently, a large randomized trial (LION, NCT00712218) found that in patients with stage IIB–IV ovarian cancer who had macroscopically complete resection and normal nodes both before and during surgery, lymphadenectomy did not improve PFS or OS, and was associated with increased rates of serious postoperative complications and mortality within 60 days after surgery.717 However, meta-analyses that included data from retrospective and observational studies have found that systematic lymphadenectomy improves OS in patients with advanced disease, even though PFS is not improved.706,707,718-720
Pelvic and para-aortic lymph node dissection is recommended for patients with disease confined to affected ovaries or to the pelvis, and for those with more extensive disease who have tumor nodules outside the pelvis that are 2 cm or less (presumed stage IIIB). Para-aortic lymph node dissection should be performed by stripping the nodal tissue from the vena cava and the aorta bilaterally to at least the level of the inferior mesenteric artery and preferably to the level of the renal vessels. The preferred method of dissecting pelvic lymph nodes is removal of lymph nodes overlying and anterolateral to the common iliac vessel, overlying and medial to the external iliac vessel, overlying and medial to the hypogastric vessels, and from the obturator fossa at a minimum anterior to the obturator nerve.541

Some surgeons classify debulking based on the number of procedures. Procedures that may be considered for optimal surgical cytoreduction (in all stages) include: bowel resection and/or appendectomy, stripping of the diaphragm or other peritoneal surfaces, splenectomy, partial cystectomy and/or ureteroneocystostomy, partial hepatectomy, partial gastrectomy, cholecystectomy, and/or distal pancreatectomy.690,695,722
Extensive resection of upper abdominal metastases is recommended as part of debulking for patients who can tolerate this surgery, as it is associated with improved PFS and OS.690,695
Select patients with low-volume residual disease after surgical cytoreduction for stage II or III invasive epithelial ovarian or peritoneal cancer are potential candidates for IP therapy.723,724 In these patients, consideration should be given to placement of an IP catheter with initial surgery.588
Surgical Considerations for Mucinous Tumors Since primary invasive mucinous tumors of the ovary are uncommon, it is important to establish the primary site in patients with these tumors. Thus, the upper and lower GI tract should be carefully evaluated to rule out an occult GI primary with ovarian metastases, and an appendectomy need only be performed in patients with a suspected or confirmed mucinous ovarian neoplasm if it appears to be abnormal.725-727 A normal appendix does not require surgical resection in this setting.

For those with more extensive disease outside of the pelvis (nodules >2 cm), suspicious and/or enlarged nodes should be resected, if possible.715,721 Systematic lymph node dissection and resection of clinically negative nodes is not required for these patients because results will not change staging and the procedure does not appear to impact OS, based on results from randomized trials (described above).715-717

Surgical Considerations for Ovarian Borderline Epithelial (LMP) Tumors Although data show upstaging with lymphadenectomy, other data show that lymphadenectomy does not affect OS.728-735 However, omentectomy and multiple biopsies of peritoneum (the most common sites of peritoneal implants) may upstage patients and may affect prognosis,734,736-741 although some retrospective studies did not find association with prognosis.729,742-744

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2024 Ovarian Cancer

Ancillary Palliative Surgical Procedures Patients presenting with symptoms may benefit from ancillary palliative procedures performed during primary or secondary cytoreductive surgery. Decisions on the use of ancillary procedures should be made in conjunction with a gynecologic oncology surgeon or a practitioner familiar with ovarian cancer patterns of recurrence. Palliative surgical procedures that may be appropriate in select patients include paracentesis or insertion of an indwelling peritoneal catheter, thoracentesis, pleurodesis, videoassisted thoracoscopy, or insertion of a pleural catheter, nephrostomy, or use of ureteral stents, gastrostomy tube, intestinal stents, or surgical relief of intestinal obstruction.
Analysis of Surgical Specimens As described in the section entitled Diagnosis, Pathology, and Staging, surgical specimens should undergo pathology assessment to determine/confirm diagnosis, determine histologic subtype, and determine stage. Molecular testing is also appropriate for most patients; see Molecular Testing section above for detailed recommendations.
Primary Treatment for Patients Referred with Diagnoses by Previous Surgery
For patients referred with newly diagnosed ovarian cancer after a recent surgical procedure, primary treatment depends on the findings noted during the workup and evaluation performed by a gynecologic oncologist, including the type of cancer, apparent stage, and the extent of residual disease. For those with an epithelial cancer and no evidence of residual disease on workup, further surgical staging is not needed if adjuvant chemotherapy is planned. For select subtypes, observation is an alternative to adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with stage IA/IB (Table 2). For patients with these subtypes and presumed stage IA/IB (and no evidence of residual disease), surgical staging can be considered if the patient would be a candidate for observation or reduced number of cycles

of adjuvant chemotherapy. In these cases, observation after complete surgical staging is an option as long as the results confirm stage IA/IB disease. If surgical staging indicates higher-stage disease, however, adjuvant chemotherapy is usually recommended, depending on the specific cancer type. In some cases with presumed stage IA–IC and no signs of residual disease detected by workup, patients may opt for surgical staging to confirm whether they will be eligible for maintenance therapy following adjuvant chemotherapy. As discussed below, bevacizumab and PARP inhibitor maintenance options are only recommended for patients with stage II–IV disease, so those with presumed stage IA–IC disease may be particularly interested in surgical staging to determine whether they should be upstaged and thus eligible and/or needing maintenance therapy.
For patients who have an epithelial cancer and evidence of residual disease on workup, tumor cytoreductive surgery is recommended if the residual disease appears resectable. Following cytoreductive surgery, adjuvant treatment recommendations depend on cancer type and stage. If the residual disease appears unresectable, patients should be treated with NACT and IDS, and postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy could be considered (see sections on Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy and Interval Debulking Surgery).
Management After Primary Surgery
In the NCCN Guidelines for Ovarian Cancer, adjuvant therapy is defined as drugs or other forms of supplemental treatment following cancer surgery intended to decrease the risk of disease recurrence or to primarily treat residual disease, whether gross or microscopic, following surgical cytoreduction. Most patients with epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer should receive adjuvant systemic chemotherapy after primary surgery. Postoperative observation is an option for select patients with stage I disease, depending on cancer histologic type and

substage, as shown in Table 2. Observation is considered an option in these select groups of stage I patients either because survival is greater than 90% with surgical treatment alone, or because for low-risk disease in certain cancer types it has not been demonstrated that adjuvant chemotherapy provides clear clinical benefit compared with observation alone for those who have had complete surgical staging.745-751 Furthermore, postoperative observation should generally only be considered for patients who have had resection of all disease and complete surgical staging to rule out the possibility of clinically occult disease that would result in upstaging. For some of the less common epithelial cancer types (eg, mucinous, grade 1 endometrioid, low-grade serous), the benefit of adjuvant systemic therapy has not been demonstrated and observation is an option (Table 2). If analysis of a biopsy or surgical specimen shows a non-epithelial cancer type, such as sex cord-stromal or germ cell tumors, a patient should be treated according to separate pathways specific for non-epithelial cancers (see Less Common Ovarian Cancers: Malignant Sex Cord-Stromal Tumors and Malignant Germ Cell Tumors in the algorithm). See sections below on these less common cancer types.
A large variety of regimens and approaches have been tested in prospective randomized trials as postoperative therapy for patients with newly diagnosed ovarian cancer. Most of these regimens have included intravenous (IV) chemotherapy, but IP administration of chemotherapy has also been tested, as have targeted agents and drugs from other classes.

Recent trials have shown that maintenance therapy after postoperative platinum-based chemotherapy can have a positive impact on PFS in patients with advanced disease, so integration of maintenance therapy as part of postoperative management is increasing in prevalence and importance.752-755 Selection of immediate postoperative treatment should be informed by eligibility criteria for maintenance therapy. This is discussed in greater detail in the section entitled Options After First-Line Chemotherapy.
Based on results of phase III randomized trials, the NCCN Guidelines include several options for postoperative treatment (within 6 weeks) in patients with advanced epithelial cancers: platinum-based IV chemotherapy, platinum-based IV/IP chemotherapy, and platinum-based IP chemotherapy plus bevacizumab, as outlined in Table 3. Specific options and supporting data for each of these categories of treatment are described in greater detail in the sections below. For stage I disease, data are more limited, and while the NCCN Guidelines include some platinumbased IV chemotherapy options, IP/IV chemotherapy and use of bevacizumab are not recommended approaches for stage I disease (Table 2). Specific options for stage I disease are also discussed in a subsequent section. For certain rarer cancer types, there are additional recommended adjuvant treatment options, including additional chemotherapy options, chemotherapy/bevacizumab regimens (stage II–IV only), and hormonal therapies (Table 2 and Table 3). More information on these options can be found in subsequent sections for specific LCOCs.

For all patients, the goals of postoperative therapy and considerations for selection and management during therapy should be discussed prior to the initiation of therapy. As for all aspects of their diagnosis and treatment of ovarian, fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer, patients should be encouraged to participate in clinical trials. Chemosensitivity/resistance and/or other biomarker assays have been proposed for informing decisions related to future chemotherapy in situations where there are multiple equivalent chemotherapy options available, but the current level of evidence is not sufficient to supplant standard-of-care chemotherapy (category 3). Prior to recommending chemotherapy, requirements for adequate organ function and performance status should be met.
During drug-based therapy, patients should be observed closely and treated for any complications. Appropriate blood chemistry tests should be monitored. Appropriate dose reductions and modifications of chemotherapy should be performed depending on toxicities experienced and goals of therapy. Consider scalp cooling to reduce incidence of alopecia for patients receiving chemotherapy with high rates of alopecia.756

Options for IV Chemotherapy Comparison of IV chemotherapy regimens for postoperative treatment of newly diagnosed ovarian cancer has been the subject of many prospective randomized trials. Most of these trials have failed to show significant differences between regimens in efficacy outcomes (eg, PFS, OS), but many have shown differences in toxicity profile, ability to complete the planned therapy, and QOL. For this reason, the NCCN Guidelines include a number of recommended options for postoperative IV chemotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer. The NCCN-recommended options for platinum-based IV chemotherapy to treat stage II–IV epithelial disease are summarized in Table 4, along with the list of trials that tested these regimens (last column). Table 5, Table 6, and Table 7 summarize the results of randomized trials that tested these recommended regimens. The most commonly used regimen, paclitaxel 175/carboplatin, has been considered the standard postoperative chemotherapy for ovarian cancer for many years, so there are many studies in which it has been tested (Table 5, Table 6, and Table 7). The history supporting these options is summarized below.

Results from multiple early trials suggested that regimens that included a platinum agent resulted in better response rates and PFS (compared with other chemotherapy options).783,784 Subsequent trials aimed at determining which platinum-based combinations are the most effective and safe.
Selecting a Platinum Agent Multiple randomized trials compared carboplatin versus cisplatin, either alone or in combination with other agents (examples in Table 5 and 6).767770,785-790 All of these trials showed equivalent efficacy, but differences in toxicity profiles and QOL. Cisplatin was associated with higher rates of neurotoxicity, GI toxicities (eg, nausea, emesis), renal toxicity, metabolic toxicities, anemia, and alopecia, while carboplatin was associated with higher rates of thrombocytopenia and granulocytopenia.767-770,785-790 The AGO-OVAR-3 study found that QOL was significantly better with carboplatin/paclitaxel versus cisplatin/paclitaxel, both in global QOL metrics and on various subscales.769,770 Several randomized studies tested alternating carboplatin and cisplatin every other course, but found that efficacy was similar and toxicity somewhat worse than using carboplatin for every course.774,790 Based on results from all these studies carboplatin is the recommended platinum agent for postoperative IV chemotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers.

Selecting a Non-Platinum Agent (for Use in Combination with a Platinum Agent) Many different chemotherapy agents have been tested in combination with platinum agents as options for IV chemotherapy in newly diagnosed ovarian cancer. Large randomized trials have compared various platinumbased doublet, triplet, and quadruplet combinations with cyclophosphamide, paclitaxel, docetaxel, topotecan, doxorubicin, epirubicin, gemcitabine, topotecan, and melphalan.764,765,773,775-777,779-782,791797 Trials that compared platinum-based doublets with cyclophosphamide versus paclitaxel showed that paclitaxel was associated with significantly better response rate, PFS and OS.791-793 Thus, paclitaxel is preferred over cyclophosphamide for platinum-based combination therapy in the first-line setting. Based on results from randomized trials showing improved safety and QOL with carboplatin/paclitaxel versus cisplatin/paclitaxel (Table 5),767-770 carboplatin/paclitaxel became the “standard” combination therapy option for postoperative first-line IV chemotherapy in patients with ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer. Most subsequent trials used this doublet, usually paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 plus carboplatin AUC 5–6, given on day 1 of a 21-day cycle, as the control arm (see examples in Table 5, Table 6, and Table 7). This regimen is also a recommended option in the NCCN Guidelines (Table 4).

Two other platinum-based doublets have shown similar efficacy to carboplatin/paclitaxel, but with different safety profiles.764,765 The SCOTROC1 study found that docetaxel/carboplatin resulted in similar PFS, OS, and global QOL scores as paclitaxel/carboplatin, and was associated with lower rates of neurotoxicity, arthralgia, myalgia, alopecia, and abdominal pain, but higher rates of other adverse events (AEs) (GI, peripheral edema, allergic reactions, and nail changes [Table 7]).765 The MITO-2 trial found that pegylated liposomal doxorubicin/carboplatin was associated with a higher response rate but similar PFS and OS as paclitaxel/carboplatin (Table 7).764 pegylated liposomal doxorubicin/carboplatin was associated with higher rates of certain hematologic toxicities, skin toxicity, and stomatitis, but lower rates of neurotoxicity and alopecia than the paclitaxel/carboplatin control.764 Global QOL and most functional domains and symptom scales were the same across treatment arms, and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin/carboplatin was associated with worse scores for certain patient-reported toxicities.764 Therefore, this regimen may be useful in select patients at high risk for neurotoxicity or those who would like to avoid alopecia. The docetaxel/carboplatin and liposomal doxorubicin/carboplatin regimens are both recommended options in the NCCN Guidelines (Table 4), and may be considered for patients who are at high risk for neuropathy (eg, patients with diabetes).798
Randomized trials testing platinum-based triplet or quadruplet regimens have generally found that these do not improve efficacy but are associated with worse toxicity when compared with platinum-based doublets773,775777,779-782 or single-agent platinum regimens.794,795 Examples of platinumbased triplet and quadruplet regimens that have been compared with the standard paclitaxel/carboplatin regimen are in Table 5 and 6. One study showed that adding gemcitabine to carboplatin/paclitaxel actually resulted in worse PFS compared with carboplatin/paclitaxel alone (Table 5 and 6).780

Carboplatin/Paclitaxel Dosing Options As noted above, for postoperative first-line treatment of ovarian cancer, the most commonly used dosing for IV carboplatin/paclitaxel combination therapy is paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 + carboplatin AUC 5–6, both given on day 1 of a 3-week cycle. As summarized in Table 7, multiple randomized studies have compared different dosing schedules for IV carboplatin and paclitaxel regimens as first-line postoperative therapy for ovarian cancer.757-761,763,799,800 Three different randomized trials (JGOG-3016, GOG-0262, and ICON8) tested “dose-dense” weekly paclitaxel dosing of 80 mg/m2 combined with the standard carboplatin dosing (AUC 6, day 1, every 3 weeks).758,760,761,763 JGOG-3016 results showed that this regimen improved PFS and OS, GOG-0262 showed that this regimen improved PFS (in the subset of patients who were not receiving concurrent bevacizumab), and ICON8 found no significant improvements in PFS or OS (Table 7). All three trials reported increased rates of neutropenia and signs of worse QOL among patients treated with the dose-dense regimen.
Two randomized trials (MITO-7 and ICON8) compared standard paclitaxel/carboplatin dosing with weekly paclitaxel (60 or 80 mg/m2) plus weekly carboplatin (AUC 2), and found no significant differences in efficacy outcomes.757-759 MITO-7, which tested 60 mg/m2 paclitaxel, showed higher rates of pulmonary toxicity, but lower rates of neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, neuropathy, hair loss, and vomiting, and significant improvement in QOL.757 ICON8, which tested 80 mg/m2 paclitaxel, showed higher rates of neutropenia and carboplatin hypersensitivity reaction, and worse global QOL compared with standard carboplatin/paclitaxel dosing.758,759 Based on these results, if a weekly regimen is used, the paclitaxel weekly/carboplatin weekly regimen using 60 mg/m2 paclitaxel is the recommended option (for stage II–IV disease; Table 4).
