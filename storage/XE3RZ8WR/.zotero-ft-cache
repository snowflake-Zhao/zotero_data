ancer immunotherapy is one of the most promising anticancer treatment strategies. The landmark example of immunotherapy success was the development of immune checkpoint inhibitors (programmed cell death–1 [PD-1] and programmed cell death ligand–1 [PDL1]). Several monoclonal anti–PD-1 and anti–PD-L1 
antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, nivolumab, and atezolizumab, are now approved for the treatment of different tumor types, including urinary tract and lung cancer (1–10). Despite the excellent results of immune checkpoint inhibitor trials, some caveats remain about optimal patient stratification (11,12). Although some

Background: Reliable predictive imaging markers of response to immune checkpoint inhibitors are needed. 
Purpose: To develop and validate a pretreatment CT-based radiomics signature to predict response to immune checkpoint inhibitors in advanced solid tumors. 
Materials and Methods: In this retrospective study, a radiomics signature was developed in patients with advanced solid tumors (including breast, cervix, gastrointestinal) treated with anti–programmed cell death–1 or programmed cell death ligand–1 monotherapy from August 2012 to May 2018 (cohort 1). This was tested in patients with bladder and lung cancer (cohorts 2 and 3). Radiomics variables were extracted from all metastases delineated at pretreatment CT and selected by using an elastic-net model. A regression model combined radiomics and clinical variables with response as the end point. Biologic validation of the radiomics score with RNA profiling of cytotoxic cells (cohort 4) was assessed with Mann-Whitney analysis. 
Results: The radiomics signature was developed in 85 patients (cohort 1: mean age, 58 years 6 13 [standard deviation]; 43 men) and tested on 46 patients (cohort 2: mean age, 70 years 6 12; 37 men) and 47 patients (cohort 3: mean age, 64 years 6 11; 40 men). Biologic validation was performed in a further cohort of 20 patients (cohort 4: mean age, 60 years 6 13; 14 men). The radiomics signature was associated with clinical response to immune checkpoint inhibitors (area under the curve [AUC], 0.70; 95% CI: 0.64, 0.77; P , .001). In cohorts 2 and 3, the AUC was 0.67 (95% CI: 0.58, 0.76) and 0.67 (95% CI: 0.56, 0.77; P , .001), respectively. A radiomics-clinical signature (including baseline albumin level and lymphocyte count) improved on radiomics-only performance (AUC, 0.74 [95% CI: 0.63, 0.84; P , .001]; Akaike information criterion, 107.00 and 109.90, respectively). 
Conclusion: A pretreatment CT-based radiomics signature is associated with response to immune checkpoint inhibitors, likely reflecting the tumor immunophenotype.

tumor tissue, which do not allow for complete tumor characterization. Tumors are spatially and temporally heterogeneous (22,23), giving imaging an advantage in guiding personalized treatment because it yields a comprehensive view of the entire tumor. Radiomics can provide noninvasive tools to study tumor biology, capture tumor heterogeneity, and monitor tumor evolution and response to therapy. In this study, we aimed to develop and test a radiomics signature from baseline (pretreatment) CT scans to predict response to anti–PD-1/PD-L1 in patients with advanced solid tumors. For a biologic validation of this radiomics signature, associations with tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and RNA profiling of cytotoxic cells were performed. We also explored the integration of CT-based radiomics and clinical data into a multidimensional signature for response.

Summary 
A CT-based radiomics signature, based on histogram, shape, and local-regional texture features, showed an association with immune response in advanced solid tumors. 
Key Results 
n In this retrospective study of 85 patients, a CT-based 14-feature radiomics signature (histogram, shape, and local-regional texture) was associated with response to immune checkpoint inhibitors in advanced solid tumors (area under curve [AUC], 0.70; P , .001; sensitivity, 75%; specificity, 53%). 
n Radiomics combined with clinical data (baseline albumin and lymphocytes) improved response classification performance compared with radiomics or clinical data alone (AUC, 0.74 vs 0.70 and 0.64, respectively). 
patients achieve dramatic responses, others do not respond at all. In addition, immune checkpoint inhibitors can cause serious side effects in some patients (13). Further immunotherapy agents are being tested in combination with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors to improve the response of immunotherapy-sensitive tumors and to convert immunotherapy-insensitive tumors into responsive tumors (14). Given this, it is critical to optimally identify patients more likely to respond to immune checkpoint inhibitors to maximize patient benefit, minimize risks, and accelerate drug development. Currently, tumor PD-L1 expression, microsatellite instability status, and tumor mutational burden are imperfect predictive biomarkers of response to anti–PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies, with varying performance across different tumor types (15,16). Radiomics derives quantitative variables from imaging data of tumor tissues by the application of data mining algorithms to medical images (1721). Much of the discussion about personalized medicine has focused on molecular characterization by using genomic and proteomic technologies. However, these often require biopsies or invasive operations to extract and analyze small portions of

E3 [online]). Radiomics data were standardized to zero-centered distributions with logarithmic transformations. 
Clinical Data 
Clinical and laboratory data were collected from electronic patient records. These included age, sex, tumor type, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, number of organs with metastasis, lactate dehydrogenase level, leukocyte count, albumin level, lymphocyte count, platelet count, and neutrophil count at baseline. Outcome data included clinical benefit and overall survival. Clinical benefit was defined as stable disease after 5 months of treatment or partial or complete response within the first 5 months of treatment according to RECIST 1.1 (28,29). 
composed of patients with different tumor types and gene expression profiling from solid tumor biopsy samples where contrastenhanced CT was performed within 4 months before biopsy. None of these patients had been included in cohorts 1, 2, or 3. All patients were treated at the Vall d’Hebron Institute of Oncology (Barcelona, Spain). Exclusion criteria for this study comprised patients who had received previous immunotherapies, nonenhanced CT, CT with artifacts, nonmeasurable lesions per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1, and lesions with cystic changes or cavitation. We also excluded patients in whom the biopsy had been performed before the CT to avoid biopsyrelated changes. The study flowchart is shown in Figure 1. 
Image Data Acquisition and Analysis 
CT scans obtained within 28 days before the treatment start date were analyzed. Contrastenhanced CT scans were acquired by using 16- or 64-channel CT scanners (Siemens, Philips, and GE Healthcare ) in the axial plane with tube voltage of 100–130 kV, section thickness of 2–5 mm, and section interval of 1.25–5 mm (Table E2 [online]). All well-defined lesions per patient were delineated by a radiologist (R.P.L., with 10 years of experience in oncologic imaging), blinded to the clinical outcome, by using the 3DSlicer version 4.8.1 (24) semiautomatic contouring tool. Images were resampled to isometric voxels of 1 3 1 3 1 mm3 by using spline interpolation. Hounsfield units were binarized to discrete values of 10 HU (25). CT-based radiomics features (first order, shape, and texture) were derived by using the Pyradiomics package (version 2.2.0) for Python (version 3.7.1), compliant with the Image Biomarker Standardization Initiative guidelines (26,27) (Table 
Figure 2: Schema shows radiomics workflow. The model was trained in cohort 1. Features were selected according to the reproducibility analysis. Then, the signature was tested in cohorts 2 and 3. Finally, a biologic validation was implemented by using RNA profiling in cohort 4.

thresholding and housekeeping adjustment. The cytotoxic cell gene set included CD8A, GZMA, GZMB, and PRF1 genes. Methods for assessment of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and radiomics–tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte associations are described in Appendix E1 (online). 
Statistical Analysis 
Test-retest reproducibility based on the acquisition protocols and interobserver reproducibility were assessed by using intraclass correlation coefficients (31) (Appendix E1 [online]). An elastic-net model was implemented for feature selection in both radiomics and clinical-radiomics signature. The regularization parameters l and a were determined by using cross validation. 
Patient follow-up was considered as the time between treatment baseline (treatment start date) and discontinuation. 
Exploring Biologic Significance of CT-based Radiomics Signature 
Assessment and immunophenotyping of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes by NanoString (NanoString Technologies) gene expression profiling of tumor samples were performed at the Vall d’Hebron Institute of Oncology (30). The CT-based radiomics score and the enrichment score of cytotoxic cells were calculated from the same biopsied lesion. The enrichment score was computed as the mean of the log-2 z-score of the transformed expression values of the gene set, after background

The radiomics signature was implemented by using generalized linear mixed models, including robust radiomics features (defined as intraclass correlation coefficient  0.7) selected by elastic net, lesion location (node, liver, lung, and others) and with consideration of patient identification as a random effect to adjust for the intrapatient variability for lesions from the same patient. The end point of the model was clinical benefit. The clinical-radiomics signature was developed by using generalized linear models that included mean radiomics score per patient and clinical data with clinical benefit as the end point. The mean radiomics score per patient was derived from the probability (p) defined as follows: 
(1), 
(2), 
where X is a matrix of Npatxp of p predictor variables, Npat is 
number of patients, and b is a px1 vector of the fixed-effects 
coefficients. Z is the Npatxq matrix for q random effects, and u is a qx1 vector of the random-effect coefficients. The radiomics score per patient (Radscorepat) is the average of all the lesion radiomics scores in a patient as defined in Equation (2) where Nlesions is the number of lesions and Radscorei is the radiomic score per lesion. The area under the curve (AUC) and 95% CI (DeLong method) were determined from the receiver operating characteristic curve, and the P value was assessed by using the MannWhitney U test. The decision threshold to determine the sensitivity and specificity was defined by maximizing the sensitivity given a minimal value of specificity of 50%. The model performances obtained by using radiomics predictive score only and by combining radiomics score with clinical data were compared by using Akaike information criterion. Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test was reported as the calibration statistic. The radiomics signature was internally validated with a stratified 10-fold cross-validation analysis (Appendix E1 [online]). A patient-level analysis was performed by using logistic regression to obtain odds ratios. A Cox proportional hazard regression model was used to associate overall survival with the radiomics and radiomicsclinical score. The proportionality of hazard assumptions was assessed with Schoenfeld residuals. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed for each variable from the radiomicsclinical signature. Overall survival analysis was performed by using the Kaplan–Meier method after score dichotomization. Patients who did not reach the end point were censored to the last follow-up date. The Harrell C-index was assessed to compare both scoring systems. Associations between radiomics score with tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and cytotoxic immunophenotype enrichment were evaluated by using Mann-Whitney analysis. The P value a level was considered to indicate significance at .05. Statistical analyses were performed by using R software, version 3.5.0. The R packages used are listed in Table E4 (online). The code can be found at https://github.com/mligerhe/ImmunoCTrad. The study workflow is summarized in Figure 2. 
Results 
Study Patient Characteristics 
Of 115 patients from cohort 1, 67 patients from cohort 2, and 63 patients from cohort 3, we excluded 13 because of noncontrast CT scans, 11 because of artifacts at the tumor site, 30 without measurable lesions per RECIST 1.1, and 13 whose scans did not fulfill the image acquisition criteria (Fig 1). In cohort 1, a total of 236 lesions (mean number of lesions per patient, three; range, one to 17 lesions per patient) from the 85 patients (mean age, 58 years 6 13 [standard deviation]; 42 women [mean age, 55 years 6 12] and 43 men [mean age, 62 years 6 13]) were included in the final analysis. The median follow-up period was 4 months (interquartile range, 2–12 months); 51% (43 of 85) of the patients showed a clinical benefit and 49% (42 of 85) of the patients did not show a complete response, partial response, or stable disease after 5 months of treatment.

The radiomics-clinical score was associated with overall survival in all cohorts (cohort 1: hazard ratio, 0.14 [95% CI: 0.04, 0.51], P = .003; cohort 2: hazard ratio, 0.02 [95% CI: 0.00, 0.20], P = .001; cohort 3: hazard ratio, 0.13 [95% CI: 0.03, 0.57], P = .01) (Table 4). Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard ratios are in Table E6 (online). Patients with a high radiomics-clinical score (score . 0.45) showed improved overall survival compared with those with a low radiomics-clinical score (score  0.45); the 24-month overall survival in cohort 2 was 53% (95% CI: 35, 79) versus 25% (95% CI: 10, 62; P = .002), and in cohort 3 it was 36% (95% CI: 21, 60) versus 5% (95% CI: 1, 34; P = .02) (Fig 5). 
Exploring the Biologic Significance of the CT-based Radiomics Signature 
Tumor RNA profiling through NanoString and CT scans was available for 20 patients (cohort 4) (sample characteristics are 
53% (25 of 47) of the patients showed a clinical benefit, and 47% (22 of 47) did not. In cohort 4, 20 patients (mean age, 60 years 6 13; six women [mean age, 55 years 6 9] and 14 men [mean age, 63 years 6 15]) were included in the final analysis for biologic validation. One lesion per patient was delineated, corresponding to the biopsied tumor in which the RNA profiling was performed. The study sample characteristics are summarized in Table 1. 
Predictive Model Development and Testing 
Twenty-six radiomics features showed an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.7 or greater in the reproducibility analysis (Appendix E1, Table E5 [online]). Elastic-net parameters were set to l of 0.001 and a of 1 for the radiomics signature, and 14 from 26 variables were retained (Table 2). In terms of classification performance, the training set had an AUC of 0.70 (95% CI: 0.64, 0.77; P , .001), the bladder test set had an AUC of 0.67 (95% CI: 0.58, 0.76; P , .001), and the lung test set had an AUC of 0.67 (95% CI: 0.56, 0.77; P , .001) (Fig 3a). Sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, and positive predictive value for identifying patients with clinical benefit with an optimal cutoff of 0.29 are summarized in Table 3. The radiomics signature showed no evidence of poor fit (Hosmer-Lemeshow, P . .05). 
Integrating Radiomics and Clinical Data 
The radiomics-clinical elastic-net feature selection retained with nonzero coefficients (elastic-net to l = 0.08, a = .9) the mean radiomics score per patient and two clinical features (albumin and lymphocytes; Table 2). The radiomics-clinical model showed an AUC of 0.74 (95% CI: 0.63, 0.84; P , .001) in the training set and AUCs of 0.74 (95% CI: 0.59, 0.89; P , .001) and 0.73 (95% CI: 0.59, 0.88; P = .002) for predicting clinical benefit in cohorts 2 and 3, respectively. Sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, and positive predictive value for identifying patients with clinical benefit with an optimal cutoff of 0.45 are summarized in Table 3. The radiomics-clinical model showed no evidence of poor fit (Hosmer-Lemeshow, P . .05). The radiomicsclinical signature presented a better performance compared with the radiomics-only signature (Akaike information criterion, 107.00 and 109.90, respectively). Clinical signature performance is reported in Table 3 and Figure E1 (online). In the patient-level analysis, an increase in the mean score per patient was associated with clinical benefit in all cohorts

Discussion 
Although immune checkpoint inhibitors have transformed the management of many tumor types, response rates are still suboptimal, and better treatment selection is required. In this study, we developed a radiomics signature that potentially allows stratification of patients who are more likely to benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors, achieving a 75% sensitivity and 53% specificity. The radiomics signature consisted of 14 features related to first-order histogram, shape, and local-regional texture (gray level–dependent matrix and gray level co-occurrence matrix derived). The negative coefficient of gray level–dependent matrix dependence variance and dependence nonuniformity normalized features, indicating homogeneous tumors, were associated with a higher probability of immune response. Similarly, first-order uniformity that reflects tumor homogeneity was associated with a higher probability of response. As a first step toward clinical application of our model, we tested it on two independent samples of patients with urinary bladder and lung cancer. In these test cohorts, the radiomics signature identified patients who benefited from treatment, with 73% sensitivity and 55% specificity in the bladder cancer cohort and 73% sensitivity and 57% specificity in the lung cancer cohort. The moderately high sensitivity of this assay indicates a potential to better identify patients who may benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors and in whom this treatment may be prioritized. In this study, we showed that integrating clinical data (albumin and lymphocytes at baseline) improved performance compared with clinical-only and radiomics-only signatures (AUC, 0.74 vs 0.64 and 0.70, respectively). 
in Table 1). In this cohort, tumors with a high radiomics score (.0.29 according to the cutoff point of the receiver operating characteristic curve) showed higher values of immune cytotoxic cells compared with the tumors with low radiomics score, but this difference was not significant (0.80 6 0.12 vs 0.62 6 0.25; P = 0.29) (Fig 6). Tumor samples for tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte quantification were available from 75 patients in cohorts 1 and 2 (Table E7 [online]). No association was identified between tumor-infiltrating

To assess for a biologic basis of the radiomics signature, we explored its association with cytotoxic immunophenotyping by gene expression profiling as a marker of tumor immunogenicity (32,33). There was no statistically significant relationship between high CT-based radiomics score and enriched cytotoxic phenotype. Few studies have been published on radiomics as a tool to assist in the medical treatment of patients with cancer undergoing immunotherapies. Sun et al (18) developed a CD8+ tumor infiltration radiomics signature. In line with our results, Sun et al demonstrated that tumor homogeneity was associated with high CD8+ tumor infiltration. Similarly, image acquisition parameters were considered for their radiomics signature development. Unfortunately, we could not correlate our signature with that of Sun et al because peritumoral radiomics features were included in their model, whereas we restricted our analysis to tumor features only because the periphery of tumors can contain artifacts (from contrast-enhanced vessels, fat, or air when the tumor is located at the organ edge). With the advent of new tools for automatic or semiautomatic image segmentation and computational image analysis and quantification of radiomics signature scores, our signature could be incorporated into clinical trials and clinical practice in the near future. Whereas our data are reassuring regarding the biologic validity of our radiomics signature, further correlative studies in larger populations should now be performed in other tumor types including correlations with PD-L1 expression, microsatellite instability status, and tumor mutation burden, all of which are approved as predictive biomarkers for immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy (34). Our study had some limitations. First, because of the observational and retrospective nature of the work, no standardization of image acquisition parameters was possible. Second, we developed a radiomics signature in a sample of multiple tumor types and validated in only two specific tumor types (bladder and lung cancer), which makes the training cohort more heterogeneous. Third, this predictive radiomics signature may be useful for anti–PD-1/PD-L1 patient selection but will require further testing in other cohorts as newer immunotherapies emerge. Last, our primary end point, clinical benefit, may not be used in pivotal trials, although we also identified an association between our signature and overall survival. In conclusion, the CT-based radiomics signature developed in this study was associated with response to immune checkpoint inhibitors in patients with advanced solid tumors. The integration of multidimensional data including radiomics, clinical variables and genomic characterization may be key to optimize immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment selection and, ultimately, improve survival and quality of life in patients with cancer.
