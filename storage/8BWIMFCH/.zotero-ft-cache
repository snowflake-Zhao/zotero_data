Abstract

Background: Although incidence rates of breast cancer molecular subtypes are well documented, effects of molecular subtypes on breast cancer–speciﬁc survival using the largest population coverage to date are unknown in the U.S. population.
Methods: Using Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results cancer registry data, we assessed survival after breast cancer diagnosis among women diagnosed during 2010 to 2013 and followed through December 31, 2014. Breast cancer molecular subtypes deﬁned by joint hormone receptor [HR, estrogen receptor (ER) and/or progesterone receptor (PR)] and HER2 status were assessed. Multiple imputation was used to ﬁll in missing receptor status. Four-year breast cancer–speciﬁc survival per molecular subtypes and clinical/demographic factors were calculated. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to evaluate survival while controlling for clinical and demographic factors.
Results: The best survival pattern was observed among women with HRþ/HER2– subtype (survival rate of 92.5% at

4 years), followed by HRþ/HER2þ (90.3%), HR–/HER2þ (82.7%), and ﬁnally worst survival for triple-negative sub-
type (77.0%). Notably, failing to impute cases with missing
receptor status leads to overestimation of survival because
those with missing receptor status tend to have worse prog-
nostic features. Survival differed substantially by stage at diagnosis. Among de novo stage IV disease, women with HRþ/HER2þ subtype experienced better survival than those with HRþ/HER2– subtype (45.5% vs. 35.9%), even after con-
trolling for other factors. Conclusions: Divergence of survival curves in stage IV
HRþ/HER2þ versus HRþ/HER2– subtype is likely attributable
to major advances in HER2-targeted treatment. Impact: Contrary to conventional thought, HRþ/HER2þ
subtype experienced better survival than HRþ/HER2– in
advanced-stage disease. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev; 27(6);

Introduction
Breast cancer molecular subtypes have been deﬁned based on gene expression proﬁling (1). The major subtypes of breast cancer are approximated by the joint expression of three tumor markers: estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor [PR, where ER and PR status are jointly assessed as hormone receptor (HR) status], and HER2 status. The four main molecular subtypes approximated by joint HR/HER2 status are: HRþ/HER2– (i.e., approximating Luminal A subtype), HRþ/HER2þ (Luminal B), HR–/HER2þ (HER2-enriched), and HR–/HER2– (triple-negative; refs. 2–4). Recently, these three tumor markers have become part of routine data collection by the population-based Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) cancer registries covering about 30% of the U.S. population (3, 5, 6).
Important differences in demographic and clinical characteristics in occurrence of molecular subtypes among women have

been described using U.S. population–based cancer registry data (3, 4, 7). In contrast, breast cancer–speciﬁc survival for each subtype is poorly documented at the national level. The use of Herceptin and other targeted therapies for HER2positive breast cancer has been clearly shown to improve survival (8–10). The clinical beneﬁts of these and other treatment advances underscore the need for national populationbased data that are speciﬁc to subtype. Although some studies have assessed outcomes by molecular subtypes, they were based on relatively small observational studies or conﬁned to a speciﬁc geographic region (11–13). Recently, a few studies utilized data from the population-based California Cancer Registry (14–18). However, most of the prior studies examining breast cancer prognosis by subtypes suffered from a large number of women with missing information on receptor status, where missing receptor statuses ranged from 12% to 33% of overall breast cancer cases (3, 11, 17–19). Furthermore, women with missing receptor status tended to be minorities, older, of lower socioeconomic status, had no insurance, or had advanced disease (3). With registry data, we are unable to assume that receptor information is missing completely at random; therefore, failing to account for missing information could bias breast cancer prognosis in the general population.
Our primary aim was to present the ﬁrst report of nationally representative breast cancer–speciﬁc survival estimates by four main molecular subtypes. We provide an assessment of demographic (age, race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, marital, and insurance status) and clinical (tumor stage, size, nodal status, and Bloom–Richardson grade) differences in breast cancer survival by subtypes using SEER data covering approximately

30% of the U.S. general population. Our second aim was to develop an imputation algorithm to ﬁll in missing receptor status, enabling us to obtain accurate estimates of breast cancer survival in the population.
Materials and Methods
Study population We identiﬁed females with invasive breast cancer diagnosed
during 2010–2013 (ICD-O-3 site codes C500-509 excluding histology codes 9050–9055; 9140; 9590–9992). Cases were followed until December 31, 2014 (allowing a maximum follow-up of 59 months). We used data from 17 population-based cancer registries that participate in the SEER program. Data from the Alaska Native Registry were excluded (n ¼ 273), since this registry does not provide any additional information on ethnic origin of these cases, i.e., whether they are of Hispanic versus non-Hispanic origin, a distinction necessary for analyses by mutually exclusive race-ethnic subgroups (i.e., non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, non-Hispanic Asian Paciﬁc Islander (API), non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaskan Native, and Hispanic). We began the analysis in 2010 when information on HER2 status was ﬁrst captured uniformly across all SEER registries (information on ER and PR status in the registries has been collected since 1990). In constructing the study cohort, we applied several exclusion criteria typically used with SEER data for survival analyses: (i) cases diagnosed by autopsy or death certiﬁcate (n ¼ 937), (ii) alive with no survival time (n ¼ 466), (iii) missing cause of death (COD, n ¼ 584). We further restricted analysis to cases that were a woman's ﬁrst or only breast cancer to create a more homogenous group, because a prior cancer diagnosis may affect patient prognosis. The ﬁnal analytic set consisted of 196,094 females diagnosed with invasive breast cancer.
Study variables Study variables such as ER, PR, and HER2 status, demographic
characteristics (e.g., age, race, ethnicity, year of diagnosis, marital, and insurance status), and tumor stage, size, nodal status, and Bloom–Richardson grade were ascertained across SEER registries using standardized coding rules based on hospital medical records and pathology reports. The four main breast cancer molecular subtypes were derived based on the joint expressions of the three tumor markers explained in detail elsewhere (3). Areabased indicators of patient poverty were derived at the county level from 2010 U.S. Census data and included as tertiles of the observed distribution in the U.S. general population. The proportion of the population in a patient's county of residence who lived below the poverty level was stratiﬁed as <10.0% (high socioeconomic status, SES), 10%–19.9% (medium SES), !20% (low SES), or unknown. The poverty indicator was used as a surrogate for low, medium, or high SES. Similarly, area-based indicators of urbanicity were derived at the county level from 2010 U.S. Census data and included as the median of the observed distribution in the U.S. general population. The proportion of the population in a patient's county of residence living in urban areas was stratiﬁed as <50% (less urban), !50% (more urban), or unknown.
Underlying COD Underlying CODs were ascertained by cancer registries from
death certiﬁcate codes obtained from the National Center for Health Statistics. To correct for known errors with COD

attribution, the SEER program recently developed a special COD variable that maps underlying CODs to the primary cancer diagnosis (20). We used this variable to assign a broad set of CODs to capture deaths due to breast cancer among women with an incident breast cancer diagnosis.
Statistical analysis Multiple imputation. The three receptor statuses (ER, PR, and HER2) had a considerable amount of missing information. Overall, 16,563 (8.4%) women had a missing HER2 status, 7,965 (4.0%) were missing ER status, and 8,763 (4.5%) were missing PR status. As a result, molecular subtypes could not be derived for 16,996 (8.7%) female breast cancer cases (Table 1). Of these 16,996 cases with missing molecular subtypes, 8,996 (52.9%) women had a known HR status but missing HER2 status, 7,567 (44.5%) women were missing both HR and HER2 statuses, and 433 (2.5%) women had a known HER2 status but missing HR status. In addition, some degree of missing data was present in clinical and demographic variables, which has been documented before (2, 3, 21, 22). For this reason, we used a sequential regression multiple imputation technique (also referred to as fully conditional speciﬁcation) to impute HER2 status, ER status, PR status, and clinical/demographic variables with sporadic missingness (23). The idea behind this imputation technique is intuitive: to model each variable with missing observations conditional on all other variables (including those with missing values) and stochastically impute from these the conditional distributions. With a sporadic missingness pattern as is present in the SEER data, the imputation procedure cycles through these conditional models to produce a speciﬁed number of imputed datasets. Thus, the ﬁnal imputed dataset would contain not only imputed HER2, ER, and PR statuses but also other variables that initially had missing information (e.g., stage, grade, node, etc.). Molecular subtype was not directly imputed, but rather derived for all cases based on observed and imputed HER2, ER, and PR status.
Supplementary Table S1 lists variables used for multiple imputation of missing HER2 status, along with the percentage of missing data for each variable. These variables were chosen based on demographic and clinical importance associated with HER2 status (2–4), and included year of diagnosis, age at diagnosis, poverty status (county level), urban indicator (county level), race, ethnicity, registry, reporting source, marital status, insurance, ER status, PR status, American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) 7th stage, tumor size, nodal status, Bloom–Richardson grade, histology, survival time, vital status, and surgery. In addition, we used vital status and the Nelson–Aalen estimator of the cumulative baseline hazard in the imputation model for imputing missing HER2 status for the survival analyses (24). Poverty, urban, race, and surgery covariates had very little missing information (<1% missing). Therefore, we used a single imputation model controlling for age, Hispanic ethnicity, registry, and year of diagnosis to ﬁll in missing information for these four covariates before performing multiple imputation on the remaining covariates in the breast cancer dataset. Because grade had the largest amount of missing information (i.e., 13.8% women with missing grade), we assessed the imputation procedure's sensitivity to inclusion or exclusion of this variable by repeating the imputation, excluding grade from the imputation model. We found no

We imputed missing HER2 status under the missing at random (MAR) assumption, as the standard sequential regression multiple imputation technique assumes the MAR mechanism. The

MAR assumption is not testable; however, we evaluated known and unknown HER2 status by demographic and clinical variables used in the imputation model (Supplementary Table S2). Missing HER2 status appeared to be associated with several of these variables, thus providing plausibility for the MAR assumption

after conditioning on these associated variables with a missing pattern of HER2 status. We used proc mi with fcs in SAS 9.3 (SAS Institute) and generated 25 imputed datasets for analyses. We generated 25 imputations based on the rule that the number of imputations should be at least equal to the percentage of incomplete cases (23). Finally, we analyzed each imputed dataset separately, and then estimates were combined using Rubin's rules (25).
Survival analyses. We present estimates of 4-year breast cancer– speciﬁc survival according to molecular subtypes and clinical and demographic factors. Breast cancer–speciﬁc survival was calculated using the actuarial method with the SEER special COD variable (20). Deaths due to breast cancer were treated as the event and other causes of death as the censoring indicator. Survival times were censored at loss to follow-up, death from causes other than breast cancer, or December 31, 2014, whichever occurred ﬁrst. Finally, a Cox proportional hazards model was used to evaluate the association between molecular subtypes and breast cancer–speciﬁc survival after controlling for demographic and clinical factors. Although a previous study showed survival curves by HRþ or HR– subtypes cross over when examining over a longer follow-up time (26), however, over the short follow-up period considered in this analysis, the proportionality assumption by molecular subtypes for the Cox model was tested [i.e., by looking at log-log (survival probability) over log (survival time) by molecular subtypes] and appeared to be valid.
Results
A total of 196,094 invasive breast cancer cases were diagnosed and reported to the SEER-18 excluding Alaska registries during 2010–2013. The proportions of women with each molecular subtype were 130,543 (66.6%) for HRþ/HER2–,

21,136 (10.8%) for triple-negative (i.e., HR–/HER2–), 19,016 (9.7%) for HRþ/HER2þ, 8,403 (4.3%) for HR–/HER2þ, and 16,996 (8.7%) unknown (Table 1). Subtype distributions varied by age, race, ethnicity, county-level poverty and urbanicity, insurance, marital status, stage, grade, tumor size, and nodal status. Compared with women with HRþ/HER2À subtype (the most common subtype), those diagnosed with the other three subtypes were somewhat more likely to be younger, belong to minority groups, living in counties with higher poverty levels, and had later stage, larger tumors, positive nodal status, and higher Bloom–Richardson grade.
Women with missing molecular subtypes tended to be older (12.5% missing among age 75þ vs. 7.5% age <50), minorities, poor, living in less urban areas, uninsured, and diagnosed with more advanced stage disease (17.2% stage IV vs. 7.1% stage I; Table 1). Supplementary Fig. S1 shows observed and imputed distributions for HER2 status by age at diagnosis based on one of the 25 imputed datasets (similar results were found when we repeated the analysis with a second imputed dataset). After imputation, the frequency distribution was shifted to the older age group from the younger age group (Supplementary Fig. S1A; Fig. 1B). This is expected because a larger percentage of older women were missing HER2 status than younger women. The percentages of HER2þ and HER2– tumors were similar across ages before and after imputation (Supplementary Fig. S1C; Fig. 1D), even though older women had more missing information.
We present 4-year estimates of breast cancer–speciﬁc survival by molecular subtypes before and after imputation (Fig. 1). Before imputation, the survival curves were overestimated, whereas after imputation, the survival curves were shifted downward. This downward shift in survival after imputation is consistent with our ﬁnding that women with missing receptor status had worse prognostic features (Table 1; Supplementary Table S2; Supplementary Fig. S2).

Figure 2.
Four-year breast cancer–speciﬁc survival by stage and molecular subtypes using imputed dataset, SEER-18 excluding Alaska. Breast cancer–speciﬁc survival curves using imputed data by stage at diagnosis and molecular subtypes are shown as follows: (A) among stage I disease, (B) among stage II disease, (C) among stage III disease, and (D) among stage IV disease; HRþ/HER2– (blue solid line), HRþ/HER2þ (red solid line), HR–/HER2þ (green solid line), triplenegative (black solid line). Note that after imputation, there are no unknown subtypes or unknown stage groups reaming in the dataset.

imputed datasets, the best survival was observed among women with the HRþ/HER2– subtype (survival rate 92.5% at 4 years), followed by HRþ/HER2þ (survival rate 90.3%), HR–/HER2þ (survival rate 82.7%), and ﬁnally worst survival
for the triple-negative subtype (survival rate 77.0%).
Although molecular subtypes affected survival, stage at diag-
nosis appeared to be the most powerful factor (Fig. 2; Sup-
plementary Fig. S2). For example, based on imputed datasets,
the survival rate for the triple-negative subtype (known for
poor prognosis) was 95.1% among stage I disease, yet dropped
to 11.2% among those with stage IV disease (Fig. 2; Supple-
mentary Table S3). Survival rates were similar between the HRþ/HER2– (the most common subtype known to have the best prognosis) and HRþ/HER2þ subtypes among women with
stage I and II disease but not stage IV disease, where survival rate was signiﬁcantly higher for HRþ/HER2þ than HRþ/HER2–

subtypes (45.5% HRþ/HER2þ vs. 35.9% HRþ/HER2–). In
Supplementary Table S3, we summarized survival estimates
by molecular subtypes and other demographic and clinical
characteristics.
After controlling for demographic and clinical factors, breast cancer–speciﬁc survival was signiﬁcantly worse among the triplenegative subtype [HR, 2.5; 95% conﬁdence interval (CI), 2.4–2.6], HR–/HER2þ (1.2; 95% CI, 1.1–1.3), but not for the HRþ/HER2þ subtype (0.7; 95% CI, 0.7–0.8), compared with HRþ/HER2– as
the referent subtype over this entire observation period (Table 2). Other factors associated with worse breast cancer–speciﬁc survival included advanced disease stage (32.7; 95% CI, 29.9–35.6), high grade (2.1; 95% CI, 1.9–2.2), non-Hispanic black race (1.1; 95% CI, 1.0–1.1), no surgery (2.8; 95% CI, 2.7–3.0), and poverty (low SES: 1.2; 95% CI, 1.1–1.3). Being married and having any type of
insurance had a protective effect on survival.

Discussion
This is the ﬁrst study to assess breast cancer survival according to molecular subtypes and important clinical and demographic features using the largest population coverage to date at the national level in the modern treatment era and correcting for missing information with unknown receptor status to obtain a more accurate estimate of breast cancer prognosis in the population. We found that breast cancer cases with HRþ subtypes are associated with the best prognosis, also shown in previous studies (17, 18, 27). By contrast, women with HR– subtypes, especially those with triple-negative disease, suffer the worst prognosis, likely because of the lack of a receptor target (e.g., ER, PR, HER2)

for therapy (18, 19, 28). In addition, stage is one of the most powerful factors determining survival outcomes. For example, among those with stage I disease, survival rate was greater than 95% regardless of subtypes after 4 years of follow-up. Among those with stage IV disease, women with the HRþ/HER2þ subtype appeared to have better survival than women with the HRþ/HER2– subtype, even after controlling for other clinical and demographic factors. A similar pattern in terms of favorable survival with the HRþ/HER2þ subtype was also shown using California Cancer Registry data (17, 18).
The triple-positive subtype has the advantage of expressing all therapeutic targets (ER, PR, HER2), which likely accounts for the superior survival we observed. Recently, a profusion of HER2-targeted therapies has entered clinical practice, including the combination of trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and chemotherapy which has yielded a median survival of nearly 5 years (56.5 months), substantially exceeding earlier median survival estimates in range of 2 years (8). Additional HER2-targeted options include trastuzumab emtansine and lapatinib (9, 10). These agents may be combined with endocrine therapy, chemotherapy, or each other, and are given sequentially in various permutations for many lines of treatment. Thus, treatment of the HRþ/HER2þ subtype has advanced beyond what is available for other types of breast cancer. Our observation of a clearly superior survival with HRþ/HER2þ disease in stage IV, and less so in earlier stages, might be due to the fact that stage I–III patients receive early HER2-targeted therapy, which may select for disease that is more resistant to HER2-directed therapies at the time of distant metastatic recurrence. Therefore, stage IV patients have the opportunity for maximal beneﬁt from HER2-targeted therapy, because they have not already developed resistance to it.
This is the ﬁrst time tumor receptor status was imputed for survival analyses using population-based registries. Use of multiple imputation to ﬁll in missing receptor status is important. If we do not impute cases with missing receptor status, we overestimate survival because those with missing receptor status tend to have worse prognostic features. We used a rich set of covariates in the imputation model to make the MAR assumptions viable. Moreover, when we evaluated missing HER2 status by clinical, demographic, and breast cancer survival, missingness was explained by these factors, making MAR assumption more plausible. One limitation of our imputation model was that we did not have information on some other potential predictors of missing HER2 status such as breast cancer risk factors, treatment, and comorbid conditions. The SEER program recommends using imputed datasets when assessing breast cancer survival in the U.S. general population. These imputed datasets can be made available through SEERÃStat software to researchers in the future (29).
There are several strengths of our study. Our results are population-based and incorporate high-quality U.S. cancer registry data. SEER registries reliably capture breast cancer cases in their catchment areas, and they have complete follow-up information for greater than 95% of cases, so reporting of survival is reliable (30). Our results are more generalizable than those from single centers, and clinical trials are unlikely to include representative samples of older, sicker, and low-income patients (31, 32). Therefore, our study best reﬂects outcomes among unselected U.S. breast cancer cases experiencing typical patterns of care.

A few limitations of our study should be noted. Because we relied on data collected by cancer registries, we did not have detailed information on use of treatments including endocrine, HER2-directed therapy and chemotherapy, individual-level SES, breast cancer risk factors, or comorbid conditions. Controlling for these factors, if possible, would likely reduce confounding and improve our understanding of survival differences by subtype. The maximum follow-up time (59 months) was limited by the year in which relatively complete receptor data became available in SEER. In particular, over a decade, the use of Herceptin and other targeted therapy dramatically changed prognosis for breast cancer, especially for HER2-positive tumor. However, central cancer registries collected HER2 status beginning with cases diagnosed only recently (from 2010þ), limiting our ability to assess long-term survival trend from breast cancer in the early part of Herceptin era.
In conclusion, we found that breast cancer prognosis in the U.S. population varies signiﬁcantly based on molecular subtypes and associated clinical and demographic features. We also found that for de novo metastatic disease, women with the HRþ/HER2þ subtype (once considered a poor prognostic feature) have better survival than those with the HRþ/HER2– subtype (often considered the best prognostic feature). This remarkable divergence of survival curves is likely attributable to major advances in HER2-targeted treatment (8–10, 33). As follow-up

time increases, SEER data can be used to monitor and better understand the impact of how targeted therapies are contributing to reduce breast cancer mortality in the U.S. population.
