Figure S1 – Image preprocessing Before feature extraction, several steps were involved to preprocess images: (1) use threshold to exclude voxels that didn’t have an intensity within the range of (mean-standard deviation, mean+8*standard deviation), to remove the noise; (2) normalize images using z-score normalization with z=100; (3) resample images to 1*1*1 mm3; (4) discretize images by a fixed bin width of 5. Below image shows the distribution of intensity range of each patient after completing image preprocessing. The intensity range had a mean of 710 and standard deviation of 203.
Figure S2. Feature repeatability of different DCE-MRI phases. The repeatability of extracted radiomics features was assessed by single rater intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) (1,1). The ICC for each feature was calculated under 30-time perturbations which involved random translation, rotation, as well as contour
randomization. The formula for ICC calculation is:
AAA − AAA
AAA + A + 1 AAA
where MSR is the mean square for all the features, MSW is the mean square for the residual sources of variance, and k is the number of measurements. The calculation of ICC was performed using python package pingouin (version 0.5.2). An ICC >= 0.9 was determined as high-repeatable. Below figures shown the feature repeatability at different DCE-MRI phases.


Figure S3. Feature change across different DCE-MRI phases. The assessment of feature change across different DCE-MRI phases involved evaluating whether the feature change calculated by subtraction was significantly different from zero. It was conducted by performiang a single-sample t test. A t test p value smaller than 0.05 was determined as ‘change’. Below figures shown the feature change across different phases. The coordinate of x-axis n/m referred to feature change = feature at phase n – feature at phase m, and 0-5 denoted pre-contrast phase and 1st to 5th post-contrast phase.

Table S3 – Example of visualizing dynamic features The table gives an example of how a dynamic feature quantify the change of a radiomics feature. The selected radiomics feature is original_glszm_LowGrayLevelZone_Emphasis. The dynamic feature is MD_hrv_classic_pnn40. It calculates the proportion of differences magnitude that is greater than 4% of standard deviation of the time series. In these figures, the x-axis denotes the phase of DCE-MRI and y-axis denotes the value of radiomics feature. And each line denotes one patient. Those have a relatively constant radiomics feature value after contrast agent injection (phase1 to phase5) were given lower dynamic feature value. This table also shows that patients with different dynamic feature value has d0i00fferent pCR rate.

*As the 10-feature dynamic model achieved the highest internal validation AUC. We further explored whether adding more dynamic features can obtain better performance. Therefore, the results of 11-feature dynamic model is also listed here.
