Abstract
Objective To investigate whether intratumoral heterogeneity, assessed via dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), reflects the molecular subtypes of invasive breast cancers. Material and methods We retrospectively evaluated data from 248 consecutive women (mean age ± standard deviation, 54.6 ± 12.2 years) with invasive breast cancer who underwent preoperative DCE-MRI and DWI between 2019 and 2020. To evaluate intratumoral heterogeneity, kinetic heterogeneity (a measure of heterogeneity in the proportions of tumor pixels with delayed washout, plateau, and persistent components within a tumor) was assessed with DCE-MRI using a commercially available computer-aided diagnosis system. Apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) were obtained using a region-of-interest technique, and ADC heterogeneity was calculated using the following formula: (ADCmax−ADCmin)/ADCmean. Possible associations between imaging-based heterogeneity values and breast cancer subtypes were analyzed. Results Of the 248 invasive breast cancers, 61 (24.6%) were classified as luminal A, 130 (52.4%) as luminal B, 25 (10.1%) as HER2-enriched, and 32 (12.9%) as triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). There were significant differences in the kinetic and ADC heterogeneity values among tumor subtypes (p < 0.001 and p = 0.023, respectively). The TNBC showed higher kinetic and ADC heterogeneity values, whereas the HER2-enriched subtype showed higher kinetic heterogeneity values compared to the luminal subtypes. Multivariate linear analysis showed that the HER2-enriched (p < 0.001) and TNBC subtypes (p < 0.001) were significantly associated with higher kinetic heterogeneity values. The TNBC subtype (p = 0.042) was also significantly associated with higher ADC heterogeneity values. Conclusions Quantitative assessments of heterogeneity in enhancement kinetics and ADC values may provide biological clues regarding the molecular subtypes of breast cancer. Key Points
• Higher kinetic heterogeneity was associated with HER2-enriched and triple-negative breast cancer. • Higher ADC heterogeneity was associated with triple-negative breast cancer. • Aggressive breast cancer subtypes exhibited higher intratumoral heterogeneity based on MRI.

Introduction
Breast cancer is highly heterogeneous in nature. Different cells of origin, as well as alterations in the genome and epigenome, likely contribute to the high intratumoral heterogeneity of breast cancer [1]. Analyses of gene expression arrays have revealed several subtypes of breast cancer that differ in terms of etiology, prognosis, and treatment response [2–4]. In clinical practice, immunohistochemical classification based on expression of the estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), and Ki-67 is used as a surrogate for the molecular classification of breast cancer subtype [5]. Breast cancer subtyping provides essential guidance regarding systemic treatment and may allow for the optimization of individualized treatment for breast cancer patients [6]. High intratumoral heterogeneity has been associated with poor clinical outcomes, which may be due to intrinsic aggressive biology or treatment resistance [7, 8]. Recently, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) texture analysis has been used to assess the intratumoral heterogeneity of breast cancer, enabling correlation with various tumor subtypes. Entropybased texture features were found to significantly differ between hormone receptor–positive and –negative cancers [9], and even between the luminal A and B subtypes [10]. These findings suggest that more aggressive breast cancer subtypes may exhibit a higher degree of textural heterogeneity via MRI. However, the implementation of texture analysis in routine clinical practice is challenged by poor standardization of this technique, the requirement of specialized software, and complicated post-processing procedures. A simple and more practical method is desirable for clinical application. In our previous works, we quantified the kinetic heterogeneity of breast cancer and calculated apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) difference values to assess intratumoral heterogeneity using dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), together with routine
clinical protocols [11, 12]. Furthermore, quantitative analysis of the kinetic heterogeneity was performed using a commercially available computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system [11] that is easy to use and can improve consistency via semiautomatic process. The results showed that higher kinetic heterogeneity and ADC difference values were significantly associated with worse distant metastasis-free survival outcomes. Thus, imaging heterogeneity may reflect the intrinsic biological heterogeneity of breast cancer. Based on these findings, we hypothesized that quantitative assessment of the heterogeneity of enhancement kinetics and ADC values could provide information regarding the heterogeneous biology of breast cancer, which may be related to intrinsic subtypes. To address this in the present study, we examined whether intratumoral heterogeneity, assessed via DCE-MRI with CAD and DWI, could provide information regarding the molecular subtypes of invasive breast cancer.
Materials and methods
This retrospective study was approved by the institutional review board of Pusan National University Hospital. The requirement for informed consent was waived (IRB No. 2006004-091).
Study population
A retrospective review of medical records collected between July 2019 and March 2020 identified 273 consecutive women with invasive breast cancer who underwent preoperative MRI and DWI. Among these patients, we excluded those who (a) received neoadjuvant chemotherapy before surgery (n = 8), (b) had undergone vacuum-assisted or excisional biopsy for diagnosis (n = 3), (c) had inadequate CAD-generated images for analysis (i.e., pixel values below the threshold and failed segmentation) (n = 13), and (d) showed poor lesion visibility on DWI (n = 1). For 27 women with multifocal or multicentric breast tumors, only the largest tumors were included in the analysis. There were no cases of bilateral breast cancer. Finally, 248 women (mean age ± standard deviation; 54.6 ± 12.2 years; range, 27–86 years) with 248 invasive breast cancers were included in this study. The median interval between MRI acquisition and surgery was 15 days (range, 5–34 days).
MRI acquisition
All breast MRI examinations were performed using a 3.0-T system (MAGNETOM Skyra; Siemens Healthcare) with a dedicated 18-channel breast coil (Siemens Healthcare). Each patient was placed in the prone position. The breast MRI protocol started with a localizing sequence followed by axial fatsuppressed T2-weighted turbo spin-echo imaging (TR/TE,

4,700/81 ms; matrix, 384 × 461; field of view, 350 × 350 mm2; section thickness, 3.0 mm). DCE-MRI images were acquired using a three-dimensional T1-weighted fast lowangle shot sequence and included one pre-contrast and five post-contrast images. After acquisition of the pre-contrast images, an intravenous bolus injection of 0.1 mmol/kg gadobutrol (Gadovist; Bayer) was administered at a rate of 2 mL/s using a power injector, followed immediately by a 20-mL saline flush at the same flow rate. Five post-contrast images were obtained at 90, 170, 250, 330, and 410 s after the contrast injection. For the DCE-MRI, the acquisition parameters were as follows: TR/TE, 5.5/2.5 ms; matrix, 384 × 346; flip angle, 12°; field of view, 350 × 350 mm2; section thickness, 0.9 mm; no gap. Axial DWI was performed before DCE-MRI using singleshot echo-planar imaging with fat suppression. Diffusion gradients were applied sequentially along the three orthogonal directions. For DWI, the acquisition parameters were as follows: TR/TE, 8,880/69 ms; matrix, 256 × 154; field of view, 340 × 205 mm2; slice thickness, 3.0 mm; no gap. The acquisition time for DWI was 222 s. Images were obtained with b values of 0, 800, and 1,200 s/mm2.
CAD analysis
All T1-weighted MRI data were transferred to a commercially available CAD system (CADstream, version 6.0; Confirma). Pixel values were compared between the precontrast and first contrast-enhanced series. Pixels with values above the 50% threshold were marked in color on an overlay map. The pixels were colored according to changes in their values between the first contrastenhanced and delayed contrast-enhanced series. Pixels with a > 10% increase in signal intensity between the last vs. first post-contrast image were classified as “persistent” (colored blue). “Washout” pixels were those with a > 10% decrease in signal intensity (colored red), and “plateau” pixels were those with a change in either direction within a 10% range (colored yellow). Kinetic heterogeneity (a measure of heterogeneity in the proportions of tumor pixels with delayed washout, plateau, and persistent components within a tumor) was calculated based on delayed kinetics measured automatically using the CAD system, as described previously [11]. The degree of kinetic heterogeneity was determined using the following formula:
Kinetic heterogeneity 1⁄4 −∑k
i1⁄41Pilogk Pi
[13], where Pi is the frequency of observations
(0 ≤ Pi ≤ 1 and ∑k
i1⁄41Pi 1⁄4 1Þ and k is the number of categorical variables.
DWI analysis
All DWI images were reviewed retrospectively by two radiologists (J.Y.K. and J.J.K., with 9 and 2 years of experience in breast MRI, respectively), and decisions were made using a consensus process. The reviewers were informed of the breast cancer diagnosis but blinded to the clinicopathological data. With reference to DCE-MRI data, the reviewers identified lesions with high signal intensity on DWI at a high b value. Next, a free-hand region of interest (ROI) was manually drawn on the ADC map that included the entire lesion in the largest cross-sectional slice. A consensus was reached between two radiologists regarding the selection of images suitable for ROI placement and the location and shape of the ROI. Necrotic, hemorrhagic, and cystic components, which could influence the ADC values, were carefully avoided with reference to T2-weighted and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images. The same method was applied to both mass and nonmass lesions to standardize the image analysis process as much as possible. The ADC for each ROI was calculated on a pixel-by-pixel basis. The mean, minimum, and maximum ADC pixel values were measured for each ROI. To evaluate the reproducibility of ADC measurements, a second measurement was performed by one radiologist at an interval of 6 months without knowledge of the previous measurement. ADC heterogeneity, as a measure of intratumoral heterogeneity on the ADC map, was calculated using the following formula:
ADC heterogeneity 1⁄4 ADCmaximum−ADCminimum
ADCmean
Histopathological analysis
The tumor size, axillary lymph node metastasis status, histological type, histologic grade, and lymphovascular invasion status were determined from surgically excised specimens. The ER and PR expression levels were evaluated using the Allred score [14]. The HER2 score was given as 0, 1+, 2+, or 3+. Tumors with a score of 3+ and/or HER2 gene amplification, as confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization, were regarded as HER2-positive [15]. Regarding the Ki-67 index, nuclear staining of at least 20% was considered to reflect a high level of expression [16]. Based on the immunohistochemistry or fluorescence in situ hybridization results for ER, PR, HER2, and Ki-67 expression, tumors were classified into the following four subtypes: ER/PR+ HER2− tumors with < 20% expression of Ki-67, luminal A; ER/PR+ HER2+ tumors or ER/PR+ HER2− tumors with at least 20% expression of Ki-67, luminal B; ER/PR − HER2+ tumors, HER2-enriched; and ER/PR− HER2− tumors, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).

Statistical analysis
Kinetic and ADC heterogeneity values were compared among the different tumor subtypes. Differences in kinetic and ADC heterogeneity values among the subtypes were evaluated using the Kruskal-Wallis test, followed by the Mann-Whitney U test for multiple comparisons with a Bonferroni correction. The receiver operating characteristic curve and the area under the curve (AUC) were used to assess the performance of kinetic and ADC heterogeneity values in discriminating breast cancer subtypes. Multivariate linear regression analysis was performed to identify variables that were independently associated with the imaging-based heterogeneity values. Using forward stepwise selection, variables with p < 0.1 in the univariate analysis were entered into the multivariate linear regression analysis. The intraclass correlation coefficient was used to assess the reliability of ADC measurements. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS (version 18.0; SPSS Inc.) and MedCalc software (version 19.6; MedCalc Software). The level of significance was set at p < 0.05 for all statistical analyses, and subsequent post hoc tests were Bonferroni-corrected (p < 0.0125).
Results
Baseline characteristics
The patients and tumor characteristics are summarized in Table 1. Of the 248 invasive breast cancers, 61 (24.6%) were classified as luminal A, 130 (52.4%) as luminal B, 25 (10.1%) as HER2-enriched, and 32 (12.9%) as TNBC. The mean tumor size of the invasive breast cancers was 2.42 ± 1.47 cm (range, 0.5–11.5 cm). The HER2-enriched and TNBC subtypes had higher proportions of larger tumors (> 2 cm) and were associated with higher histological grades (grade 3) compared to the luminal subtypes. There were no differences in the age, axillary nodal status, and the presence lymphovascular invasion among the breast cancer subtypes (Figs. 1 and 2).

respectively). In the post hoc multiple comparison test, kinetic heterogeneity values differed significantly not only between the luminal A and HER2-enriched subtypes (p = 0.001) but also between the luminal A and TNBC subtypes (p = 0.001). The kinetic heterogeneity values also differed significantly between the luminal B and HER2-enriched subtypes (p = 0.001) as well as between the luminal B and TNBC subtypes (p = 0.001). For ADC heterogeneity, we observed a significant difference between the TNBC and HER2-enriched subtypes (p = 0.008). Furthermore, the ADC heterogeneity value differed between the luminal A and TNBC subtypes (p = 0.05) as well as between the luminal B and TNBC subtypes (p = 0.036), although the differences were not significant (the Bonferroni-corrected p value threshold for significance was < 0.0125). There were no significant differences in the kinetic and ADC
heterogeneity values between the luminal A and B subtypes (Table 2 and Fig. 3).
Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis
The results of the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis for kinetic heterogeneity and ADC heterogeneity are shown in Table 3 and Fig. 4. To distinguish the luminal A/B subtypes from the HER2-enriched and TNBC subtypes, the AUC values for kinetic heterogeneity were 0.711 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.646, 0.771; p < 0.001) and 0.667 (95% CI, 0.604, 0.725; p = 0.001), respectively. For ADC heterogeneity, the AUC value for distinguishing the luminal A/B subtypes from the TNBC subtype was 0.610 (95% CI, 0.546, 0.671; p = 0.037), and that for distinguishing the HER2-enriched subtype from the

TNBC subtype was 0.705 (95% CI, 0.569, 0.818; p = 0.004) (Table 3 and Fig. 4).
Univariate and multivariate linear regression analyses
In the univariate linear regression analyses, the HER2enriched subtype (p = 0.002), TNBC subtype (p = 0.002), a younger age (< 45 years) (p = 0.013), larger tumor size (> 2 cm) (p = 0.005), the ductal histologic type (p = 0.022), and a high histologic grade (grade 3) (p = 0.003) were significantly associated with a higher kinetic heterogeneity value. The presence of lymphovascular invasion (p = 0.012) was also significantly associated with a higher ADC heterogeneity value, whereas the TNBC subtype (p = 0.052) exhibited a trend toward an association with a high ADC heterogeneity value (Tables 4 and 5). Variables with a p value < 0.1 were included in the multivariate analysis and forward stepwise selection was applied. Finally, multivariate linear regression analysis showed that the HER2-enriched subtype (p < 0.001), TNBC subtype (p < 0.001), a younger age (< 45 years) (p = 0.011), and the presence of lymphovascular invasion (p = 0.022) were significantly associated with a higher kinetic heterogeneity value. The TNBC subtype (p = 0.042) and the presence of lymphovascular invasion (p = 0.010) were also significantly associated with a higher ADC heterogeneity value (Tables 4 and 5).
Reproducibility of ADC measurements
The intraclass correlation coefficients for the mean, minimum, and maximum ADCs were 0.94 (95% CI: 0.92, 0.95), 0.93 (95% CI: 0.91, 0.95), and 0.89 (95% CI: 0.86, 0.91).
Discussion
In this study, we quantified the intratumoral heterogeneity of breast cancer based on CAD-generated kinetic features and ADC values, and performed characterization of breast cancer subtypes. We found that the kinetic and ADC heterogeneity values differed significantly among breast cancer subtypes. The TNBC subtype exhibited higher kinetic heterogeneity and ADC heterogeneity values, while the HER2-enriched subtype showed higher kinetic heterogeneity values compared to the luminal subtypes. Furthermore, our multivariate analysis indicated that a higher kinetic heterogeneity value was significantly associated with the TNBC and HER2-enriched subtypes, whereas a higher ADC heterogeneity value was significantly associated with the TNBC subtype. Our findings suggest that aggressive subtypes of breast cancer may exhibit higher intratumoral heterogeneity as assessed by DCE-MRI with CAD and DWI. The quantitative assessment of imagingbased heterogeneity may provide biological information related to the molecular subtypes of breast cancer that are important determinants of prognosis and management of breast cancer, and may potentially allow for more individualized treatment strategies. Furthermore, the advantages of the imagingbased heterogeneity assessment in this study are its noninvasive nature and the potential for easy application in routine clinical practice. Breast cancer subtypes exhibit distinct imaging features. Some characteristic features of TNBC can be found on breast MRI, such as a round or oval shape, smooth margin and rim enhancement, and high intratumoral signal intensity on T2weighted images [17–20]. Non-mass enhancement is rare in TNBC and is found in only 5% of cases [19]. In a recent study that quantitatively assessed breast tumor roundness on MRI, patients with TNBC had higher roundness scores than did

those with luminal and HER2-enriched subtypes [21]. By contrast, luminal breast cancers are more frequently characterized by irregularly shaped masses on MRI, with spiculated or irregular margins [18–20]. Phenotypes for MRI-based imaging of breast cancer could help to differentiate between the molecular subtypes. Beyond morphological differences among tumor subtypes, functional differences have been evaluated to characterize
breast cancer subtypes using breast MRI. Previous studies have investigated the relationship between DCE-MRI enhancement kinetics and tumor subtypes, but the results were inconsistent. For instance, whereas Algazzar et al. showed that the HER2-enriched and TNBC subtypes were significantly associated with delayed washout kinetics [22], other studies reported that each subtype had a heterogeneous kinetic distribution, without clearly dominant delayed enhancement parameters [23–25]. According to our results, delayed enhancement curve types did not show differences among the subtypes. We presumed that the single curve type could not help to characterize breast cancer subtypes, and thus we quantified the degree of kinetic heterogeneity using delayed enhancement kinetics, which were automatically measured from a CAD system, to better evaluate this relationship. We found a significant relationship between aggressive subtypes, such as TNBC and HER2-enriched tumors, and higher kinetic heterogeneity values. DWI is commonly used as a component of multiparametric imaging for the evaluation of breast cancer, and the value of the ADC as a quantitative biomarker in clinical practice has been previously suggested [26–30]. Here, we referred to the heterogeneous diffusion signal within a tumor as “ADC heterogeneity” and calculated this using the ADC difference value (difference between the minimum and maximum ADC) and the mean ADC value. As with kinetic heterogeneity revealed by DCE-MRI, we hypothesized that ADC heterogeneity might also reflect intratumoral heterogeneity and that the degree might differ according to the different subtypes. We observed a higher ADC heterogeneity value for the TNBC subtype compared with the other subtypes, which is in line with a previous study showing that luminal A tumors had lower ADC entropy values compared to those for the other subtypes. In that study, ADC entropy was used as indicator of tumor heterogeneity and determined using a volumetric ADC histogram [31]. Therefore, we believe that MRI-based heterogeneity assessment using kinetic and ADC heterogeneity values could help identify aggressive phenotypes of breast cancer, which may have clinical implications for cancer treatment. In addition, lymphovascular invasion, which has been associated with breast cancer outcomes [32], found to have a significant relationship with both kinetic and ADC heterogeneity value at our multivariate analysis. Age also showed a significant relationship with ADC heterogeneity value. However, other established prognostic factors, such as tumor size, axillary node status, and histological grade, did not show significant associations with MRI-based heterogeneity. It is well known that TNBC is an aggressive cancer subtype with the worst prognosis [33]. TNBC is very heterogeneous and complex, at both the genetic and

molecular levels. It is highly associated with the presence of intratumoral necrosis and a fibrotic focus [34]. Vascular endothelial growth factor, which is a major stimulator of angiogenesis [35], is frequently overexpressed in TNBC [36]. Thus, the various histopathological components and spatial variations in TNBC angiogenesis may be reflected in the tumor enhancement kinetics and ADC value, which explains the higher kinetic and ADC heterogeneity values observed in the present study. The HER2-enriched tumor is another aggressive subtype of breast cancer with a poor prognosis [33]. In our study, the HER2-enriched subtype was associated with the highest kinetic heterogeneity among the tumor subtypes. Similar to TNBC, HER2 expression is also associated with overexpression of vascular endothelial growth factor [37]. The new capillaries formed via angiogenesis are typically immature and more permeable than the normal vasculature, which may cause spatial heterogeneity [38, 39]. This could explain the higher kinetic heterogeneity value for the HER2-enriched subtype. However, the
HER2-enriched subtype was associated with the lowest ADC heterogeneity value among the tumor subtypes. Although the reason for this is not clear, the higher mean ADC value of the HER2-enriched subtype may contribute to the lower ADC heterogeneity value. In our study, the HER2-enriched subtype was associated with a higher mean ADC value (0.88 × 10−3 mm2/s) compared to the other subtypes, similar to previous reports [29, 40]. In HER2-eneriched tumors, increased neovascularity, higher vascular permeability, and a consecutive increase in extracellular fluid may contribute to an increased mean ADC value [30]. In addition, considering that mammographic calcification is more common in HER2-enriched tumors [41, 42], the presence of microcalcifications within the tumor decreases the cellular density and therefore leads to increased diffusion. Our study had some limitations. First, it used a retrospective design and was conducted at a single tertiary academic center. Therefore, there might have been patient selection bias. Second, all MRI scans were obtained using

a single MRI unit and analyzed using one CAD software package. As kinetic parameters can be influenced by the MRI protocol, coil equipment, and CAD software used [43], the generalizability of our findings may be limited. Furthermore, our results could only be implemented when using a CAD software. Third, ADC heterogeneity was calculated based on various ADC metrics obtained from a representative slice of the ADC map, which may not reflect the actual whole-tumor characteristics, especially in non-mass lesions. Whole-tumor histogram analysis of the ADC may better reflect the intratumoral heterogeneity of breast cancer. Finally, we only focused on differences in enhancement kinetics and ADC values based on DCEMRI and DWI according to breast cancer subtypes and did not perform any morphological analyses. Several distinct morphological features of tumor subtypes have been reported [17–20], and the incorporation of these morphological characteristics into functional features may be
useful in building a model for predicting breast cancer subtypes. Further large-scale prospective studies are needed to validate our findings. In conclusion, MRI-based heterogeneity differed significantly among breast cancer subtypes. A higher kinetic heterogeneity value was significantly associated with the TNBC and HER2-enriched subtypes, and a higher ADC heterogeneity value was significantly associated with the TNBC subtype. Our findings suggest that imaging-based heterogeneity values can be used as imaging biomarkers to identify aggressive subtypes of breast cancer. Quantitative assessment of the heterogeneity in enhancement kinetics and ADC values may provide biological information related to the molecular subtypes of breast cancer.
