Table S2. Coronary computed tomography angiography acquisition protocol Preparation
 Assess heart rate and rhythm. Heart rate control (below 65 beats per minute) reduces motion artifacts.
 Heart rate modulation for heart rates >60/min during breath holding. o Oral: metoprolol tartrate 100 mg, one hour before the exam. atenolol 50 mg, one hour before the exam. o IV: metoprolol 5 mg, repeated up to 5 times. o Contraindications: conduction delays, hypotension, severe asthma, allergy to betablockers, reduced left ventricle ejection fraction. o Consider ivabradin for patients with contra-indications to betablockers (in case of ivabradine the dosage suggested is 5 mg twice a day for at least 3-4 days before the scan)
 Full explanation of exam, and practice breath hold. Ensure breath hold time will be sufficient for scan time. Evaluate impact of breath holds on heart rate.
 Nitrates and FFRCT. • use NTG preferably 3 minutes prior to CT image acquisition; • use 1-2 sprays (0.4mg-0.8mg) • use beta-blocker with it to avoid reflex tachycardia/vasoconstriction • additional Beta blockade may be given after nitroglycerin to counteract the reflex tachycardia
 Confirm absence of allergy to contrast media (consider prophylaxis for patients with doubtful or mild reactions to contrast in the past).

Patient installation  Attach ECG leads, avoid respiratory muscles, check signal stability during breath hold.  Placement of an IV catheter that allows a flow of at least 5 ml/sec
Data acquisition: 1) Overview/scout of the entire chest. 2) Contrast enhancement:
 300 g/L iodine contrast medium.  Injection rate: 5-6 ml/s.  Total amount depends on the patient size, the scan mode and the scan duration.  Contrast-scan timing:
o Test/Timing Bolus: 15-20 ml of contrast is injected, preferably followed by a bolus chaser. Place the localizer line one centimeter below the carina and just above the base of the heart, the optimal location to find the ascending aorta for a timed contrast injection. The time of (maximum) enhancement is used as the delay of the data acquisition after start of contrast injection.
o Bolus tracking/Smart Prep: arrival of the (entire) bolus is monitored by using a 4chamber view.
 A saline bolus of 50 ml is injected after the contrast medium at the same rate. 3) Scan mode :
 ECG-triggered one-beat scan mode should be used. For HR <65, 75% of the R-R cycle is appropriate. For HR>65 or variable heart rates, 40-80% of the R-R cycle is appropriate with ECG mA modulation. Consider use of Auto-Gating functionality on the system.
4) Acquisition parameters:  Thinnest detector width.

 For patients acquired in standard mode we suggest 100 kVp/500 mA for BMI<25; 100 kVp/550 mA for BMI included between 25 and 30 and 120 kVp/600 mA for BMI>30; for HD mode we suggest 100 kVp for BMI<25, together with 550 mA
 Scan range: from 1-2 cm below the carina until the caudal border of the heart.  High Definition Mode should be used preferably except in patients with BMI > 25
Alternate Data Acquisition protocols may be applicable based on local experience and expertise. These alternative protocols will be reviewed and approved by the Steering Committee including potential review of sample clinical cases. Image reconstruction (appropriately labelled):
 0.625mm slice thickness  ASIR-V 50% in all cases should be provided. Additional ASIR-V levels may be provided
if ASIR-V 50% is inadequate.  Field-of-view enclosing the entire heart (cover inferior carina to lower heart border)
(approx. 18 x 18 cm).  Standard kernel reconstructions of at least three different phases. Depending on the scan
protocol both diastolic and systolic reconstructions should be performed.  Reconstructions should be optimized for the segments of interest (ROI). In case of
suboptimal image quality other phases should be explored.  Additional high-definition reconstructions should be provided at the optimal phase(s). If
High Definition mode was not performed, then Detail kernel reconstructions should be provided  If motion artifacts persist in the optimal phase images, the standard and high definition (or detail) reconstructions should be done with “Temporal Enhanced” enabled and SnapShot

Freeze processing should be performed on the Advantage Workstation. DVD/USB recording:
 Scout images  ECG trace  Standard kernel reconstructions for at least one (or the same) optimal phase for each
diseased coronary segment, preferably three or more datasets including both systolic and diastolic phases. SnapShot Freeze processed images should be provided if any motion persists in the optimal phases (the accuracy of FFR-CT need to be evaluated for images reconstructed with SSF).  HD or Detail reconstructions for at least one (or the same) optimal phase for each diseased segment. SnapShot Freeze processed images should be provided if any motion persists in the optimal phases (the accuracy of FFR-CT need to be evaluated for images reconstructed with SSF).

Table S3. Primary and secondary end points

Primary Endpoint

Inter-rater agreement, as assessed by Cohen’s Kappa, on revascularization strategy of two Heart

Teams using an “Angio-first” algorithm (based on invasive SYNTAX Score II) or a “CT-first”

algorithm (based on non-invasive SYNTAX Score II, without FFRCT).

The Heart Team consensus on therapeutic strategy is made according to the following 3 options:

CABG-only.

1. CABG-only. Patient should be treated by CABG due to high 4-year mortality of PCI according

to therapeutic recommendation of SYNTAX Score II.

PCI-only/ Equipoise.

1. Equipoise. Patient could be treated by either CABG or PCI, considering that the 4-year

mortality prediction is similar between PCI and CABG.

2. PCI-only. Patient should be treated by PCI due to high 4-year mortality of CABG according to

therapeutic recommendation of SYNTAX Score II

*The Heart Team can overrule the SYNTAX Score II therapeutic recommendation whenever the

Heart Team identifies significant additional clinical risks which are not addressed in the

SYNTAX Score II.

Secondary endpoints

Secondary endpoints of this study are to assess:

•

Level of agreement in the decision making strategy based on CT only without functional

assessment and the decision making strategy based on CT with functional assessment (“CT first”

algorithm group).

•

Level of agreement in the decision making strategy based on CT only (with functional

assessment) and the decision making strategy based on CT with functional assessment and

conventional angiography (“CT first” algorithm group).
