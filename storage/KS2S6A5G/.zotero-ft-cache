ABSTRACT
Objectives: Recent studies have shown strong correlation of pathologic complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy with survival and prognosis in breast cancers.
Methods: Clinical data from 237 breast cancer patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy between 2012 and 2014 were reviewed. Correlations were sought between pCR and estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and HER2 status; Nottingham and nuclear grades; tumor tubule formation; mitotic score; Ki67 index; and tumoral and stromal lymphocytic infiltration (TLI and SLI, respectively).
Results: Of the 237 cases, 104 (43.9%) achieved pCR. The HER2þ and triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) subtypes had higher pCR rates compared with the luminal subtype (ERþ or PRþ and HER2–). ER and PR negativity, HER2 positivity, Nottingham grade 3, increased TLI and SLI, high mitotic count and Ki67 score correlated significantly with pCR in the overall cohort. TLI and SLI correlated significantly with pCR in the HER2þ and TNBC subtypes in multivariate analysis, whereas no biomarkers correlated with pCR in the luminal subtype.
Conclusions: In addition to the pathologic parameters and biomarkers already routinely assessed, evaluation of TLI and SLI may help to better select patients with HER2þ and TNBC for neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
Breast cancer is the most prevalent malignancy and second deadliest cancer in women. Currently, the main treatments include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation and targeted therapies. Chemotherapy as a systemic control regimen has dramatically increased the disease-free survival and overall survival rate.1,2 Chemotherapy can be administrated before or after surgery. When chemotherapy is given before surgery, it is referred as neoadjuvant therapy. For decades, neoadjuvant therapy has been used to treat locally advanced tumors to be operable. Recent research and clinical trials have shown strong correlation of breast cancer responses to neoadjuvant therapies with survival and prognosis.3-5 Patients who achieve pathologic complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant therapy tend to have improved disease-free and overall survival compared with patients with residual invasive disease.6,7 pCR is defined as no invasive carcinoma in the breast
Upon completion of this activity you will be able to: • know the current definition of pathologic complete response (pCR) of breast cancer in a neoadjuvant therapy setting. • describe the pCR rates associated with different major subtypes of breast cancer. • discuss the association of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in pCR in HER2+ and triple-negative breast cancer.

and lymph nodes at the time of surgery. Because of the strong correlation between pCR and survival, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) now considers pCR to neoadjuvant chemotherapy a surrogate endpoint for clinical trials and drug approval.8 The strongest correlation between pCR and outcomes is found within the triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and HER2þ breast cancers.9 Predicting which patients will achieve pCR to neoadjuvant chemotherapy is important because neoadjuvant chemotherapy is not without risk. For instance, although neoadjuvant chemotherapy can prolong disease-free and overall survival, it may increase the rate of ipsilateral tumor recurrence compared with adjuvant therapy.2 In addition, delaying surgery may decrease survival.10 A variety of methodologies have been investigated, such as magnetic resonance imaging,11 positron emission tomography,12 and gene expression profiling.13 However, none has been universally accepted, and these modalities are expensive and not routinely performed. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of tumor morphology and biomarker status, and correlated these parameters with pCR rate in a neoadjuvant setting.
Material and Methods
Patient Selection and Clinicopathologic Characteristics
A total of 2,691 consecutive excisional specimen cases were retrieved from the archives of the Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine at Emory University from 2012 to 2014 after protocol approval from the Emory Institutional Review Board. All surgical procedures were performed at two major teaching hospitals of Emory University. Among the 2,691 cases, 237 patients had neoadjuvant therapies. Of the 237 cases, 229 cases had the status of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and HER2 expression available, and 195 cases had information of biopsy diagnoses. Among the 195 cases, 129 had core biopsy slides available, and all of these 129 cases were reviewed by a pathologist (XL). For the cases without biopsy slides, information was retrieved from the patient’s medical record and pathology report. The majority of the patients received four cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapies. HER2þ cancers received HER2 targeted therapies in addition to neoadjuvant chemotherapies. Clinicopathologic characteristics of all patients were summarized in Table 1 .
Pathologic Evaluation
The following morphological features and biomarkers were evaluated in the biopsy specimen: tubule formation (score 1-3), nuclear grade (score 1-3), mitotic count (score 1-3) per the College of American Pathologists (CAP)
recommendation, Nottingham histologic grade (score 1-3), stromal and tumoral lymphocytic infiltration (SLI and TLI, respectively), fibrosis (scored 1-3 as follows: 1, mild; 2, moderate; 3, severe), ER and PR expression, and HER2 amplification (positive or negative per American Society of Clinical Oncology recommendation) and Ki67 score (high: 15%; low: <15%). TLI was evaluated as percentage of tumor cells infiltrated with lymphocytes. SLI was evaluated as percentage of stromal area covered by lymphocytes. The stroma included both intratumoral stroma as well as the stroma adjacent to the periphery of the tumor.
Breast Cancer Classification and Definition of pCR
Tumors were classified as luminal, HER2þ, or TNBC. The luminal subtype was defined as ERþ and/or PRþ and HER2–. HER2þ cancer was defined by either a score of

3þ from immunohistochemical (IHC) study or positive HER2 amplification by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) regardless of ER or PR status. TNBC was defined by the absence of ER and PR expression and HER2 overexpression by IHC or FISH. Standard 1% expression rate was used as the cutoff to define positivity in ER and PR expression. pCR was defined as no invasive carcinoma in both breast and lymph nodes at the time of surgery. In situ carcinoma was allowed in the pCR cases.
Statistical Analysis
Logistic regression was performed on the total patient cohort as well as the subtypes with a pCR case indicating an event. Odds ratios (ORs), which indicate a multiplicative effect in the odds of achieving a pCR, were compared between categorical groups (using the lowest risk group as the reference). Multivariate models were fit via a backwards selection method, in which the full model was reduced and refit stepwise by removing the least significant variable based on Wald test for the individual parameters, until either all variables had been removed or all had a P value <.10. Due to the variability in multivariate data completeness, we also used the Firth penalized likelihood approach. Correlations were analyzed using the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient. statistical analysis software was used for all statistical analysis.
Results
Clinicopathologic Features of the Cases
Of the total 237 patients, 91 (38.4%) were younger than 50 years of age, 78 (32.9%) had advanced-stage disease (pT3 or pT4), and 104 (43.9%) had pCR. Among the 229 cases with available biomarker information, 72 were luminal, 79 were HER2þ and 78 were TNBC (Table 1). In the non-pCR patients, the size of residual invasive carcinoma ranged from 0.5 to 9 cm.
HER21 and TNBCs Have Higher pCR Rate Than Luminal Breast Cancer
Subtype analysis revealed that 20 of 72 (27.8%) luminal type, 46 of 79 (58.2%) HER2þ and 37 of 78 (47.4%) TNBC exhibited pCR. On univariate analysis, the HER2þ and TNBC had 3.6 and 2.4 times the odds of achieving pCR compared with the luminal subtype (95% confidence interval [CI] 1⁄4 1.83-7.17, P < .001 and 1.194.64, P 1⁄4 .014, respectively) Table 2 . Univariate analysis failed to identify any parameter or biomarker as significantly correlated with pCR rate in the luminal subtype.
High TLI and SLI Are Significantly Associated With pCR Rate in HER21 Breast Cancers and TNBCs
TLI (both with 3% as threshold and as a continuous increasing value) as well as SLI (both with 5% as threshold and as a continuous increasing value) were significantly associated with pCR in the overall cohort (Table 2). The categorical cutpoints (3% in TLI and 5% in SLI) were chosen by using the threshold that was at the intersection of specificity and sensitivity when identifying pCR patients vs nonpCR patients. On univariate analysis, high TLI and SLI were both found to be significantly associated with a greater probability of pCR in HER2þ and TNBC cancers (Table 2). This significant correlation persisted in HER2þ and TNBCs in multivariate analysis Table 3 . No correlation between TLI or SLI and pCR was seen in the luminal type.
ER and PR Expression Is Associated With Decreased pCR in the Overall Cohort and HER21 Breast Cancers
Positivity of ER and PR expression was found to be associated with decreased pCR in the overall cohort and within the HER2þ subtype (Table 2). With increased ER or PR expression, there was a small decrease in the odds of a pCR.
High Mitotic Count and Ki67 Score and Nottingham Histologic Grade 3 Are Significantly Associated With pCR Rate in the Overall Cohort
Nottingham histologic grade 3 and high mitotic count had a positive correlation with the probability of pCR in the overall cohort (OR 3.47; P 1⁄4 .022 and OR 3.44; P < .001, respectively; Table 2). Along with the positive correlation of mitotic count and pCR, Ki67 score (both 15% as threshold and as increasing absolute value) was significantly associated with pCR (Table 2). The mitotic count remained a significant predictor of pCR in the overall cohort in multivariate analysis (Table 3).
High Correlation Between Stromal and Intratumoral Lymphocytic Infiltration
TLI and SLI are very highly correlated in the overall cohort (r 1⁄4 0.68, P < .001) and within each subtype, HER2þ (r 1⁄4 0.52, P < .001), luminal (r 1⁄4 0.85, P < .001), triple negative (r 1⁄4 0.69, P < .001). Such strong correlation was seen in multivariate analysis model. When we swapped SLI with TLI in the final multivariate model, very similar ORs (0.96 vs 0.95) and OR P values (.013 vs .017) with correlation of pCR were obtained.
Luminal Type Breast Cancers Have Low pCR Rate and No Parameter Is Strongly Associated With pCR
Among all 3 subtypes, the luminal type had the lowest pCR rate of 27.8%, compared with 58.2% in HER2þ and

47.4% in TNBC. No pathologic parameter or biomarker was identified to have significant association with pCR in the luminal type.
Discussion
In our study, we have performed a comprehensive evaluation of tumor morphology and biomarker statuses, and correlated them with pCR rate in the neoadjuvant setting. We found that pCR was significantly higher in the HER2þ and triple-negative subtypes (58.2% and 47.4%, respectively) compared with the luminal subtype (27.8%). The odds of achieving a pCR in HER2þ cancers were 3.6 times higher than in luminal cancers. This result is similar to that found in the metaanalysis by Houssami et al of 30 studies encompassing 11,695 patients, which estimated that pCR occurred in 8.3% of hormonal receptor positive (HRþ)/HER2–, 18.7% of HRþ/HER2þ, 38.9% of HR–/HER2þ, and 31.1% of TNBCs. The pCR rates in our study were slightly higher than those in the metaanalysis by Houssami et al, but high pCR rates of TNBC and HER2þ breast cancers have been reported.14 The different pCR rates in different studies might be due to variation of subtypes of breast cancers. For example, TNBC has been classified into six subtypes, and these subtypes might have different clinicopathologic characteristics and respond differently to chemotherapies.15-19 Furthermore, Houssami et al found that the odds of achieving a pCR was 7 times higher for patients with HR–/HER2þ breast cancer and 5 times higher for patients with TNBC in comparison with patients with the HRþ subtype.9 Several other studies that investigated the use of anti-HER2 therapies in the neoadjuvant setting have found that the pCR rate varies from 20% to 65% in HER2þ cancers.1,20-24 Other studies have also reported an increased pCR rate in TNBCs as compared with non-TNBCs (22% vs 11%).1,25-27 While Tan et al reported that ER and PR negativity significantly correlated with pCR in multivariate analysis, we found that ER and PR
negativity were only associated with pCR in univariate analysis, indicating that ER and PR negativity is associated with HER2þ or triple-negative status.28 In our study, HER2þ cases included HRþ as well as HR– cases. Within the HER2þ group, we found that pCR positively correlated with ER and PR negativity. Von Minckwitz et al suggest that pCR may not be a suitable endpoint for the luminal subtypes. Specifically, they found that in low-proliferative subgroups (which included lobular, grade 1 and HRþ tumors) pCR conferred no predictive power in disease-free or overall survival, in contrast with the high-proliferative subgroup (which included ductal, grade 2/3, and HR– tumors) in which pCR was associated with improved disease-free and overall survival.7 We too determined that pCR is significantly associated with high histologic grade and mitotic activity in both univariate and multivariate analyses across the entire cohort. We report a strong correlation between pCR and Ki67 score both as a categorical variable (specifically, when 15% is set as the threshold for defining high proliferation index) and as a continuously increasing variable, similar to the findings of other studies.1,29-32 Brown et al, who measured Ki67 expression using quantitative automated quantitative analysis by immunofluorescence (AQUA), found that both average and maximum AQUA scores were significant predictors of pCR to neoadjuvant therapy in multivariate analysis.32 Kim et al found Ki67 expression to be the only independent predictor of pCR and also discovered that a Ki67 value of greater than 25% was a significant predictive factor for pCR.29 Yoshioka et al found that high Ki67 was a predictive marker for pCR and that all patients achieving pCR were disease-free by the study’s end.31 Furthermore, high Ki67 expression in tumors of posttreatment was strongly correlated with poor disease-free and overall survival regardless of subtype in their study. We found high mitotic score positively correlated with pCR. A mitotic count of >9/mm2 was reported to be significantly correlated with pCR by Balmativola et al.33 Based on these compelling data, mitotic count and Ki67 should be considered for inclusion in routine

clinical evaluation of patients with HER2þ or TNBC to help determine whether neoadjuvant chemotherapy is indicated. Herein, we additionally found TLI and SLI to be significantly correlated with pCR in univariate analysis in HER2þ breast cancers (OR 1⁄4 0.94, P 1⁄4 .028). Our results are similar to those reported by Mao et al, who carried out a systematic review and metaanalysis to evaluate the predictive roles of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer.34 They evaluated a total of 13 studies that included 3,251 patients. In pooled analysis, they found that the detection of higher TIL numbers in the pretreatment biopsy was correlated with better pCR to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (OR 3.93; 95% CI 1⁄4 3.26-4.73). Moreover, TILs predicted higher pCR rates in HER2þ and TNBCs (OR 1⁄4 2.49 [95% CI 1⁄4 1.61-3.83] and OR 1⁄4 5.05 [95% CI 1⁄4 2.86-8.92], respectively), but not in ERþ breast cancer (OR 1⁄4 6.21 [95%CI: 0.86-45.15]). In multivariate analysis, they found that TILs were still an independent predictor for high pCR rate (OR 1⁄4 1.41 [95% CI1⁄4 1.19-1.66]).34 Furthermore, they found that, in three studies that examined lymphocyte-predominant breast cancer (LPBC; defined as having >50% or 60% lymphocytic infiltration of the tumor bed or stroma), LPBC patients had higher pCR rates compared with nonLPBC patients (OR 1⁄4 3.64 [95% CI 1⁄4 2.70-4.90]).35,36 Other studies have evaluated the density of TILs as per 10% increase in the number of lymphocytes infiltrating either intratumoral or stromal compartments, both of which predicted better pCR (OR 1⁄4 1.35 [95% CI1⁄4 1.27-1.44] and OR 1⁄4 1.26 [95% CI, 1.20-1.32], respectively). Altogether, their analysis indicated that TIL infiltration was an independent predictive marker for higher pCR rate (OR 1⁄4 1.41 [95% CI 1⁄4 1.19-1.66]), whether TILs were detected in intratumoral (OR 1⁄4 1.23 [95% CI 1⁄4 1.12-1.34]) or stromal (OR 1⁄4 51.22 [95% CI 1⁄4 1.09-1.36]) compartments.34 While other studies have used higher thresholds in evaluating TLI and SLI, we report significantly higher pCR rates even with very low thresholds (3% and 5%, respectively). Our study reveals that TLI and SLI are highly correlated with each other, and both are significantly associated with pCR in univariate analysis. Furthermore, TLI and SLI are each individually correlated with pCR in multivariate analysis, and assessment of both variables together does not give any additive value in predicting pCR. During our evaluation of the H&E slides, we found that TLI was challenging to assess, usually requiring tedious evaluation at high power. Therefore, evaluating SLI alone might be sufficient to assist in predicting pCR. In conclusion, our comprehensive evaluation of pathologic features in conjunction with biomarker statuses shows that HER2 positivity, TNBC, high Ki67 and mitotic indices, and TLI and SLI are strongly associated with pCR
in patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy. While evaluation of ER, PR and HER2 statuses is mandated by CAP, routine testing of breast cancers for Ki67 expression is not currently required by either the American Society of Clinical Oncology or the National Comprehensive Cancer Network. It might be useful to report SLI and Ki67 in addition to Nottingham histologic grade and receptor statuses. The combination of all these parameters might help to better predict response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and select patients for neoadjuvant therapy. Patients who are unlikely to respond to neoadjuvant chemotherapy may thus be prescribed alternate therapy regimens and spared the side effects of a probably futile treatment program that would delay a more successful strategy.
