ABSTRACT
Post-mastectomy radiation therapy (PMRT) is standard therapy for advanced breast cancer. However, given the lower risk of recurrence, PMRT administration remains controversial in select patients with limited nodal disease. We performed a review of the literature that focuses on the eﬀect of PMRT in breast cancer patients with 1–3 positive lymph nodes, mainly examining loco-regional recurrence (LRR) and overall survival (OS). Most studies, including a large meta-analysis by the EBCTCG, showed a signiﬁcant improvement in LRR rates among patients receiving PMRT. While most studies demonstrated a trend towards OS improvement, only few studies showed a statistically signiﬁcant OS or breast cancer-speciﬁc survival beneﬁt for PMRT. As such, individualized treatment decisions are recommended, taking into consideration clinicopathological ﬁndings. Future studies with large sample sizes and long follow-up times are still needed to better assess the role of PMRT in patients with limited nodal involvement.

1. Introduction
Post-mastectomy radiation therapy (PMRT) is an integral part in the management of breast cancer. It has been shown to decrease the incidence of loco-regional recurrence and improve breast cancer survival (Senkus et al., 2015). In patients with node positive disease or high risk node negative disease, chest wall and nodal irradiation is commonly performed. The extent of axillary lymph node spread plays a major role in radiation therapy decisions (Senkus et al., 2015). Despite the fact that past trials showed survival improvement in all node positive patients, the applicability of these ﬁndings to patients with N1 disease is still debatable. In this context, data from recent randomized controlled trials is scarce. As a result, there are notable diﬀerences in international guidelines regarding radiotherapy administration for 1–3 positive LN patients.
The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) recommends strongly considering PMRT, even with limited nodal involvement (1–3+ LNs) (Network NCC, 2019). However, during the most recent St. Gallen consensus discussions, only 29 % of the panel members felt that radiation therapy should be oﬀered for 1–3 positive LNs disease, while

the majority (56 %) agreed that regional nodal irradiation should only be administrated in these patients when they present with poor prognostic features (eg: triple negative cancer or residual disease after primary systemic therapy) (Balic et al., 2019). The ASCO/ASTRO/SSO joint panel recently agreed that available evidence is in favor of PMRT administration in order to reduce loco-regional recurrence (LRR) and breast cancer mortality. However, in some subsets of breast cancer, the risk of LRR is low, and the absolute beneﬁt of radiation therapy might be outweighed by its associated toxicities (Recht et al., 2016).
In this context, PMRT administration is still controversial in breast cancer patients with 1–3 positive lymph nodes. We aim to perform a review of the literature, focusing on studies that assess PMRT in this subset.

2019. We chose studies that analyzed the eﬀect of radiation therapy versus no radiation therapy in breast cancer patients. All studies that recruited patients with 1–3 positive lymph nodes were included in our review. Randomized and non-randomized trials, systematic reviews of randomized trials, and retrospective studies that reported either locoregional recurrence or overall survival are presented in this review.
Unpublished material, abstracts and ongoing trials were excluded from this review. Any study that did not stratify patients into a “1–3 positive lymph node” group was omitted. Additionally, studies that reported neither loco-regional recurrence nor overall survival were excluded.
2.2. Data analysis
Data was manually extracted from studies and inserted into spreadsheets. Table 1 summarizes our literature review regarding clinical outcomes of breast cancer patients with 1–3 positive lymph nodes. Number of patients, median follow-up, study inclusion criteria, surgery, and systematic therapy use were all recorded in tables. The main outcomes of interest were loco-regional recurrence rates and overall survival. For these outcomes, percentages and hazard ratios (HRs) with corresponding p-values were presented when available. Also, adjusted models or propensity-matched models were used when possible. Each study was analyzed in the context of its population characteristics, considering T staging, hormone receptor status, HER-2 receptor status, type of surgery and the use of systemic therapy.
3. Results
Results from the majority of studies demonstrate a positive eﬀect of radiation therapy in decreasing LRR, with ten studies showing statistically signiﬁcant LRR improvement (Ebctcg et al., 2014; Zeidan et al., 2018; Tam et al., 2017; He et al., 2015; Abdel-Rahman, 2019; Miyashita et al., 2017; McBride et al., 2014; Tendulkar et al., 2012; Cosar et al., 2011; Overgaard et al., 2007) (Table 1). Most notably, the EBCTCG meta-analysis was performed on studies recruiting more than 8000 women between 1964 and 1986. The study had a long follow-up for breast cancer recurrence at around 10 years, and a 20-year follow-up for breast cancer mortality. The study included trials with patients that completed mastectomy and axillary surgery, and that were then randomized to receiving PMRT or no PMRT. The meta-analysis showed that within the pN1 subgroup (1314 patients) treated with systemic therapy, PMRT decreased the 10 year rate of LRR by 16.5 % (p < 0.001) and reduced the 20-year breast cancer mortality by 7.9 % (RR = 0.78, 95 % CI = [0.64–0.94], p = 0.01) (Ebctcg et al., 2014). Additionally, the study showed a lower rate of any recurrences in patients receiving PMRT as compared to those who did not (RR = 0.67, 95 % CI = [0.55–0.82], p < 0.001). Overgaard et al. performed a retrospective subgroup analysis on the Danish Breast Cancer Cooperative Group 82 b& c trials. 3083 patients underwent total mastectomy and partial axillary dissection. Pre and postmenopausal women were included, and subsequently randomized to receiving PMRT and chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone. All patients received CMF chemotherapy, and post-menopausal patients received additional Tamoxifen to their regimen. With a median follow-up of 18 years, the study showed that PMRT in patients with 1–3 positive lymph nodes (552 patients) decreased LRR risk from 27 % to 4 % (p < 0.001) and increased overall survival from 48 % to 57 % (p = 0.03) (Overgaard et al., 2007). N1 patients in this study had either T1 (47 %) or T2 (48 %) disease, with only 5 % of patients having T3 disease. Hormone receptor and HER-2 receptor status were not reported. Furthermore, this study showed that the beneﬁt of PMRT in N1 patients was similar to that seen in patients with 4 or more positive lymph nodes.
Results from the 20-year follow-up of the British Columbia study by Ragaz et al. showed that the magnitude of the impact of radiotherapy in N1 subgroup was similar to those with greater nodal involvement in

terms of survival rates after treatment with CMF chemotherapy and modiﬁed radical mastectomy (Ragaz et al., 2005). However, in the 1–3 positive lymph nodes subgroup, PMRT only showed statistically signiﬁcant improvement in breast cancer speciﬁc survival ([Relative Risk (RR) = 0.64, 95 % CI = [0.42–0.97]). In this same subgroup, LRR (RR = 0.46, 95 % CI = [0.18–1.13]), OS (RR = 0.76, 95 % CI = [0.50–1.15]) and systemic breast cancer-free survival (RR = 0.68, 95 % CI = [0.45–1.04])showed a non-signiﬁcant improvement with PMRT (Ragaz et al., 2005). These studies represent data that involved the use of less eﬀective chemotherapeutic agents and lacked targeted and hormonal therapies (Ragaz et al., 2005).
In more recent studies that involve the use of eﬀective systemic therapies, the eﬀect of PMRT on OS and LRR was less pronounced. Zeidan et al. performed a retrospective analysis of the Breast International Group 02-98 trial where patients were randomized to receive adjuvant anthracycline with or without taxane therapy. The study included 684 N1 breast cancer patients. Approximately 2/3 of the patients had T2 disease and positive ER status. Results from this study only showed a signiﬁcant decrease in LRR when patients were not on taxane based chemotherapy (No Taxane-group: LRR decrease from 9.1%–3.4 % p = 0.02 vs Taxane-group: LRR decrease from 5.3 % to 2.0 %, p = 0.08) (Zeidan et al., 2018). In this same study, PMRT showed a non-signiﬁcant improvement in OS (HR = 0.79, p = 0.24) (Zeidan et al., 2018). Additionally, in 2017, Tam et al. analyzed the BCIRG-005 trial for the eﬀect of PMRT on LRR and OS (Tam et al., 2017). The trial was originally designed as a randomized controlled trial that recruited patients between 2000 and 2003 to compare concomitant vs sequential docetaxel. The study identiﬁed 523 N1 breast cancer patients, with the majority having positive ER or PR status. Tam et al. showed that LRR signiﬁcantly decreased with PMRT (HR = 0.15, p = 0.002) while there was no signiﬁcant eﬀect on OS (p = 0.9) (Tam et al., 2017). This trend is common among recent studies where improvements only show statistical signiﬁcance in LRR, and PMRT tends to show only milder, nonsigniﬁcant OS beneﬁt (He et al., 2015; Abdel-Rahman, 2019).
4. Discussion
Radiation therapy often improves survival by preventing recurrences not prevented by the sole use of chemotherapy (Whelan and Levine, 2005). In this article, we examined the eﬀect of PMRT on breast cancer patients with 1–3 positive lymph nodes, through analyzing 15 studies published since 2005.
Breast/chest wall with nodal radiation therapy is commonly performed on patients with node positive disease or high-risk node negative disease. The extent of nodal irradiation is typically medial to the coracoid process unless in bulky disease or extensive nodal involvement (N2-3) where axillary nodes lateral to the coracoid process are included in the irradiation ﬁeld.
Generally, PMRT is well tolerated with patients being able to continue their normal routines, notwithstanding speciﬁc acute and late side eﬀects. Toxicities of PMRT are divided into acute (occurring within 3 months of radiotherapy) and chronic. Most common acute adverse events include fatigue, sore throat, cutaneous ﬁbrosis, and dermatitis. Chronic side eﬀects associated with PMRT include radiation pneumonitis, secondary malignancies, radiation induced cardio-toxicity, hypothyroidism, and arm lymphedema (Christante et al., 2010). In particular, late cardio-toxicity associated with PMRT might play a role in counterbalancing the OS beneﬁt of PMRT. A recent study by Warren et al. reported that the 2-year cumulative incidence of lymphedema signiﬁcantly increased with radiotherapy reaching as high as 21.9 % in patients with regional nodal irradiation (supraclavicular nodes) compared to 3.0 % in patients not receiving radiotherapy (Warren et al., 2014). PMRT also poses a signiﬁcant risk on patients planned to undergo immediate prosthetic breast reconstruction. A meta-analysis of 15 RCTs demonstrated an increased risk of overall complications (OR:3.45, p < 0.00001) and capsular contracture (OR:5.26,

p < 0.00001) (Pu et al., 2018). Overall, in the published studies analyzed, the eﬀect of PMRT on OS
was not as signiﬁcant as its eﬀect on LRR. Despite many studies showing trends towards improved OS in patients receiving PMRT, only two of the studies showed statistically signiﬁcant results (Huo et al., 2015; Overgaard et al., 2007). The following portrays a discrepancy between LRR and OS beneﬁt in patients with limited nodal involvement breast cancer. While it is possible that LRR improvement does not translate in survival beneﬁt, this inconsistency can be attributed to the fact that many of the studies had a short follow-up time. Additionally, it is possible that most studies did not have large enough samples to detect beneﬁts in OS. This is particularly evident in the EBCTCG metaanalysis, in which the large number of patients with long follow-up time did lead to a statistically signiﬁcant breast cancer mortality beneﬁt in patients receiving PMRT (Ebctcg et al., 2014). For N1 patients, the meta-analysis shows that the OS beneﬁt of PMRT start at 10 years out. As such, future prospective trials with longer follow-up times are required to better assess the role of PMRT on OS.
Most of the studies included in this article involved the use of complete axillary node dissection. Multiple studies have shown the safety of omission of axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) in sentinel node (SN) negative disease (Giuliano et al., 2000; Bergkvist et al., 2008; Veronesi et al., 2003). Furthermore, results of the randomized controlled trial, AMAROS, show that in T1-2 breast cancer patients with positive sentinel lymph nodes, axillary radiation therapy provides comparable disease control to axillary lymph node dissection, with even less morbidity (Donker et al., 2014). Galimberti et al., in the IBCSG 23-01 trial, supported omission of lymph node dissection in minimal to moderate sentinel lymph node involvement (Galimberti et al., 2018). Thus, current surgical practices tend to shift away from ALND towards a more conservative approach in the management of micrometastatic lymph node disease. Further de-escalation of ALND is being evaluated in the SOUND (Gentilini and Veronesi, 2012) and SENOMAC (de Boniface et al., 2017) trials that aim to investigate disease control and prognosis in selected group of patients who omitted sentinel biopsy. All in all, these changes impose a further limitation on the applicability of the studies we are reviewing in the modern era.
Another shift in current practice is the increased use of neoadjuvant systemic therapy in breast cancer (Santa-Maria et al., 2015). Many patients presenting initially with limited positive nodal breast cancer respond to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. In this population, the question remains on whether PMRT would derive further recurrence and survival beneﬁt. The NSABP B51 trial evaluates whether there is added beneﬁt of chest wall and regional irradiation after surgery for patients with complete pathological response in the previously positive LNs following neoadjuvant chemotherapy (Clinical Trials.gov [Internet]: National Library of Medicine (US), 2013).
Finally, SUPREMO is an open-label, international randomized controlled trial that compares the use of radiation therapy versus no radiation therapy (Velikova et al., 2018). The trial focuses on patients with intermediate-risk breast cancer, including N1 patients, and aims at studying overall survival as a primary endpoint. Another ongoing RCT, TAILOR RT, focuses on regional radiotherapy for biomarker low risk (ER positive, HER-2 negative) patients of limited nodal involvement (Clinical Trials.gov [Internet]: National Library of Medicine (US), 2018). With large sample size and long follow-up times, these trials might give better insight in the treatment of intermediate and low risk breast cancers, respectively.
This article is a narrative review which presents qualitative research where systematic data analysis is not presented. Therefore, the ﬁndings presented should be considered in the light of some limitations. Risk of bias was not assessed in this study, and as such, a systematic review is still needed to better clarify the debate regarding N1 breast cancer patients. However, our study presents the largest review of the literature to date in regard to that topic.
In the absence of high-level evidence and in the light of the stated

limitations of this article, we recommend that treatment decisions be based on individual clinicopathologic factors associated with signiﬁcant risks of locoregional recurrence. These include age, positive surgical margins, advanced stage, molecular subtype (especially HER-2 positive and triple negative disease), and high lymphatic involvement (Merino et al., 2018; Li et al., 2014). Those patients are most likely to derive beneﬁt from PMRT. It is also prudent to consider the overall treatment beneﬁt in context of the patient’s performance status and existing comorbidities. While the PMRT beneﬁt might seem smaller in recent studies due to the advances of chemotherapy, it is worth noting that the adverse events of PMRT are also signiﬁcantly less, especially with modern radiation therapy techniques (Shaitelman1 TAB et al., 2014). This was demonstrated in a 2-year follow-up of an RCT that compared IMRT to the standard two-ﬁeld technique that showed a decrease in late toxicity, especially telangiectasia (Barnett et al., 2012).
Recent advances in molecular proﬁling of breast cancer allow clinicians to individually tailor radiation therapy decisions based on locoregional risk stratiﬁcation and radio-sensitivity of each cancer subtype. Kyndi et al. investigated the role of PMRT based on biological subtypes (Kyndi et al., 2008). In this analysis, hormone receptor negativity and positive HER-2 expression were signiﬁcantly associated with increased risk of LRR. Moreover, no survival beneﬁt was seen in those patients. However, improved OS after PMRT was noted in patients with positive hormone receptor status (Kyndi et al., 2008). Additionally, a recent analysis of HER-2 positive breast cancer patients showed a loco-regional control beneﬁt for the addition of PMRT in patients with either ER or PR expression HR = 0.26, CI = [0.08-0.79], p = 0.02). However, no PMRT beneﬁt was shown in patients that did not express neither ER nor PR (p = 0.07) (Abi Jaoude et al., 2019). Others have proposed the 21-gene recurrence score assay to predict beneﬁt of PMRT in N1 patients (Goodman et al., 2018). Moving forward, molecular proﬁling seems to be a promising approach to identify the subset of N1 patients who beneﬁt from addition of PMRT.
In conclusion, data from previous studies have shown improvement in LRR rates in breast cancer patients with 1–3 positive lymph nodes receiving PMRT. However, in this population, PMRT might play a smaller role in improving overall survival. Also, the magnitude of the LRR and OS beneﬁt is smaller in more recent studies compared to historical ones, showing a shift to decreasing beneﬁt of PMRT over time. Our review shows that N1 breast cancer patients with bad prognostic factors might still derive beneﬁt from the addition of PMRT to their treatment. Future studies, including analysis of real-life data and possibly randomized trials, are needed to better assess the role of PMRT in 1–3 positive lymph nodes breast cancer patients and to identify those who can beneﬁt the most from PMRT, based on speciﬁc risk factors.
