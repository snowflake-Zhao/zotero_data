Robert S. Laramee
The Big Data Story
Sally discovers that she can collect
data cheaply
Sally collects a LOT of data, likely
years worth
Sally eventually wants to derive
knowledge and extract insight from
the data
She discovers what a challenge this
is due to the size and complexity of
the data
Sally passed a magic threshold and
a special gap appears


3
Robert S. Laramee
The Universal Big Data Story
Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)
Engineers: simulation data
Physicists and Astronomers:
experiments & images
Marine Biologists and Bio-Chemists:
accelerometers, simulations
Psychologists, Sociologists,
Criminologists: EEG, Surveys
Sports Scientists: video & events
Journalists, Humanities: writing & text
data
Governments and Councils: public
sector data
Banks etc: customer and finance data
Call Centers: customer and employee data
Retail: customers, sales, financial, stock data
Web sites: Web traffic data, internet data
Transportation: air traffic, trains, automobile,
cycling, walking data
You: photos, videos, and files
Everyone and Everywhere
People like to collect
But there's a catch...

The Visual Cortex
 Visualization exploits our powerful
visual system
 2 million nerve fibers coming from optic
nerves
 Several billion neurons devoted to
analyzing visual information (30%
cortex)
 8% for touch, 3% for hearing (Discover,
1993, Ware, 2013)
 Enables massively parallel processing
of the visual field, i.e., incoming color, motion, texture, shapes etc.


5
Robert S. Laramee
Visualization Background
 Manual Visualization is very old
 Often an intuitive step to make
something clearer, e.g., a graph
 Classical (easy) approaches known
from business graphics (Spreadsheet
software...)
 Classical approaches are very limited
 Computer-Aided Visualization is its own
scientific discipline since 1987
 First visualization conference in 1990
Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519)
1997

Robert S. Laramee
Visualization Goals
Visualization, in order to:
 Explore
no a-priori knowledge about the data,
Visualization serves to explore the data
 Analyze
There is a hypothesis,
Visualization Serves to Confirm/Refute (Disprove)
 Present
The data characteristics are well known, Visualization.
Serves to communicate the results


11
Robert S. Laramee
Visualization Foci
Three main sub-fields:
 Volume Visualization
 Flow Visualization
 Information Visualization
Scientific Visualization
3D
nD
Inherent
geometry
Usually no inherent geometry

The Visualization Pipeline
Standard processing stages in
Visualization: A data centric
view


13
Robert S. Laramee
Visualization Pipeline Overview
Data acquisition
Data enhancement
Visualization mapping
Rendering (3D or 2D)
Data is produced or
acquired
Data is prepared (or
preprocessed)
Data is mapped to
geometric primitives
Data is transformed
into images


14
Robert S. Laramee
Visualization Pipeline Phase 1
Data acquisition Data is generated
(or acquired)
Data is produced and archived. This is what everyone is good at.
 Measurement, e.g., CT, MRI
 Written down, scanned in as text
 User Input, into databases or spreadsheets
 Simulation, e.g., Computational Fluid Dynamics
Simulation (CFD).
 Modeling, e.g., Computer Aided Design (CAD),
dynamical systems
 Videos or images are recorded


15
Robert S. Laramee
Visualization Pipeline Phase 2
Data enhancement
1. Data is acquired
(or produced)
2. Data is prepared
(or “preprocessed”)
Data enhancement = Data preparation/preprocessing
 Filtering, e.g. smoothing (noise filtering)
 Errors are discovered and corrected
 Missing values may be handled
 Resampling or modify grid representation
 Derive new data, e.g., gradients
 Data interpolation


16
Robert S. Laramee
Visualization Pipeline Phase 3
Visualization mapping
2. Preprocessed data
3. Data is mapped to
geometry
Visualization mapping results in Data being visible
Data is represented by geometric primitives: points, lines,
triangles, polygons, cubes, tetrahedra, of varying size, shape,
color, transparency
 Compute isosurface
 Compute glyphs or icons
 Compute graph layout
 Compute voxel attributes: color, transparency, ...


17
Robert S. Laramee
Visualization Pipeline Phase 4
Rendering (3D or 2D)
3. Data is mapped to
geometry
4. Data becomes an
image(s)
Rendering involves representation with Computer Graphics (CG)
 Projection (3D → 2D)
 Visibility calculation
 Shading
 Compositing (accumulate transparency and color values)
 Animation

About Data
Data characteristics,
Data attributes, Data dimensionality


Robert S. Laramee
A Data Centric Point of View
Data is:
§ The focal point of visualization: visualization starts with
data
§ Data: a “driving factor” (along with the user) with respect
to the choice and attributes of the visualization method
Important questions:
§ What is the dimensionality of the data?
§ Where does the data come from?
§ Which visualization methods make sense?
§ Why did the user collect the data?
§ What would the user of the data like to learn?


Robert S. Laramee
Data Dimensionality
What dimensionality is the data?
§ Scientific Visualization: inherent spatial domain (SciVis):
§ 1D, 2D, 2.5D or 3D dimensionality given
§ instantaneous or time-dependent (+1D)
§ examples: medical data, data from flow simulation, GIS
data...
§ Represents a physical phenomenon
§ Information Visualization: no inherent spatial reference
(InfoVis):
§ abstract data,
spatial arrangement is designed or derived for
visualization
§ examples: databases, text, spreadsheets, surveys,
monetary, call center, images, sound


Robert S. Laramee
Data Characteristics
What characteristics does the data have?
Data types:
§ Scalar: numeric e.g. natural, integer, rational, real
numbers, complex numbers
§ Vectors and tensors
§ non-numeric: nominal, ordinal values, text
§ multi-dimensional or multi-attribute values: n
dimensional, columns in a spreadsheet, e.g. car type,
manufacturer, year of manufacture, country of origin, mpg,
horsepower, number of cylinders, retail price...
Characteristics: dimensionality, domain (upper and lower bounds), distribution, scale, size, resolution


Robert S. Laramee
Data Presentation
How can data be presented?
§ Is there an inherent spatial domain?
§ If yes then use inherent domain?
§ If no then which spatial domain?
§ Which dimensions are used for what purpose?
§ What is relationship between dimensionality and
data characteristics
§ Available Presentation Space (2D/3D/4D)
§ Where is the Focus?
§ Is some data more important than other?
§ What can be left out?

Robert S. Laramee
Visualization and Color
Tips for the Application of
Color in the Visualization


Robert S. Laramee
Application of Colors
Consider:
§ color can strengthen information
§ the maximum number of colors to use for categorical
data 7±2
§ approximately 50–300 distinguishable color shades
(different depending on color)
§ rainbow of colors ≠ linear
§ color perception is depends strongly on context
§ some users are color blind
§ colors have associations


Robert S. Laramee
Choosing Colors with Color Brewer


Robert S. Laramee
Mach-Band Effect
Characteristics:
§ Eyes strengthen
boundaries
§ This can
introduce
mistakes in
discretion
§ Attention should
be paid to color
intensity


Robert S. Laramee
Color Gamuts
Display devices are
non-uniform:
§ Color space
non-uniform
§ Color
correction


Robert S. Laramee
Tips for Application of Color
Useful:
§ gray scale lines as color boundaries
§ avoid dark blue for details, animations
§ dark blue and red do not mix
(Why? That’s why.)
§ avoid high color frequency
§ context, association is important
§ good: color for qualitative visualization (as opposed
to quantitative
§ color can be used to strengthen boundaries

Robert S. Laramee 6
Information Visualization versus Scientific
Visualization
• Abstract Data
• n-dimensional
• Very important:
– visual metaphor
– user interaction
– exploration, analysis
(visual analytics),
presentation
• Spatial data
• 1, 2- or 3-dimensional,
time-dependent
• Very important:
– 3D rendering
– fast rendering
– analysis, exploration,
presentation


Robert S. Laramee 7
Two Important Goals
An intuitive visual metaphor:
§ How can abstract information be represented
visually?
§ How can high-dimensional data be depicted?
§ 2D or 3D visualization?
§ How can we position or place the data in space?
§ Integration of Focus and Context?
A proper interaction scheme:
§ Modification of visual parameters and metaphors
§ Change of focus


Robert S. Laramee 8
Special Challenges
Often large amounts of data. How can we enable
visualization and:
§ selection of data subsets
§ aggregation of data
§ extraction of meta data
Extended data structures, complex data inter-dependencies
§ deep hierarchies, large graphs,
multi-modal data
§ different kinds of inter-dependencies, i.e.,
relationships
§ pattern finding capabilities are very important


Robert S. Laramee 9
Dealing with Large Amounts of Data e.g., Big
Data
Subsampling/Subsetting techniques
§ sampling
§ querying
Segmentation techniques
§ segmentation: separation into subsets
Aggregation techniques
§ aggregation:
sum, count, minimum, maximum, average...
§ frequency-based techniques

Visualization of Hierarchies


Robert S. Laramee 12
Hierarchical Data
Visualization techniques:
§ conventional approaches such as
Trees, File System Windows, Venn Diagrams
§ Tree maps
§ Examples


Robert S. Laramee 13
Hierarchical Data
Trees:
§ ordered
§ acyclic
§ hierarchical

Visualization
Emphasize Features,
Visualize the Rest as Context


Robert S. Laramee 24
Focus+Context Visualization
Problem and Motivation:
§ large amounts of data, i.e. number of data samples
exceeds display space
§ varying importance and focus
§ if only data in focus is shown, then
problems stem from orientation and navigation
§ if only overview is provided then
no details can be obtained
Can both be included?
§ multiple views, view linking
§ Focus + context techniques, combinations of
colormapping, varying opacity, varying zoom levels


Robert S. Laramee 25
