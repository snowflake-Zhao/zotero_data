Abstract Background  The registration committee for esophageal cancer in the Japan Esophageal Society (JES) has collected the patients' characteristics, treatment, and outcomes annually. Methods  We analyzed the data of patients who had visited the participating hospitals in 2014. We collected the data with a webbased data collection system using the National Clinical Database. We used the Japanese Classification of Esophageal Cancer 10th edition by JES and the TNM classification 7th edition by the Union of International Cancer Control (UICC) for cancer staging. Results  A total of 9026 cases were registered from 344 institutions in Japan. Squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma accounted for 87.9% and 7.1%, respectively. The 5-year survival rates of patients treated using endoscopic resection, concurrent chemoradiotherapy, radiotherapy alone, and esophagectomy were 87.1%, 33.7%, 25.3%, and 59.3%, respectively. Esophagectomy was performed in 5204 cases. Concerning the approach used for esophagectomy, 48.1% of the cases were treated thoracoscopically. The operative mortality (within 30 days after surgery) was 0.75%, and the hospital mortality was 2.0%. The survival curves showed an excellent discriminatory ability both in the clinical and pathologic stages by the JES system. The survival of pStage IV was better than IIIC in the UICC system, because pStage IV included the patients with supraclavicular lymph-node metastasis (M1 LYM). Conclusion  We hope that this report contributes to improving all aspects of diagnosing and treating esophageal cancer in Japan.

Preface 2014
We sincerely appreciate the outstanding contributions of many physicians in the registry of esophageal cancer cases. The Comprehensive Registry of Esophageal Cancer in Japan, 2014 was published here. Since 2019, the data collection method was changed from an electronic submission to a web-based data collection using the National Clinical Database (NCD).
These data were first made available on July 15, 2021, as the Comprehensive Registry of Esophageal Cancer in Japan, 2014.
The authors were members of the Registration Committee for Esophageal Cancer, the Japan Esophageal Society, and made great contribution to the preparation of this material.

We briefly summarized the Comprehensive Registry of Esophageal Cancer in Japan, 2014. According to the subject year, the Japanese Classification of Esophageal Cancer 10th by the Japan Esophageal Society (JES) [1] and the Union of International Cancer Control (UICC) TNM Classification 7th [2] were used for cancer staging. A total of 9026 cases were registered from 344 institutions in Japan. Tumor locations were cervical in 4.8%, upper thoracic in 12.9%, middle thoracic in 46.5%, lower thoracic in 27.2%, and esophagogastric junction in 7.8%. Superficial carcinomas (Tis, T1a, T1b) were 37.2%. As for the histologic type of biopsy specimens, squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma accounted for 87.9% and 7.1%, respectively. Regarding clinical results, the 5-year survival rates of patients treated

using endoscopic resection, concurrent chemoradiotherapy, radiotherapy alone, and esophagectomy were 87.1%, 33.7%, 25.3%, and 59.3%, respectively. The endoscopic submucosal dissection accounted for 92.6% of endoscopic resection. Esophagectomy was performed in 5204 cases. Concerning the approach used for esophagectomy, 48.1% of the cases were treated thoracoscopically. The operative mortality (within 30 days after surgery) was 0.75%, and the hospital mortality was 2.0%. The Kaplan–Meier survival curves diverged according to the N-grade both in the JES and the UICC classifications. The survival curves showed an excellent discriminatory ability both in the clinical and pathologic stages by the JES system. In contrast, in the UICC system, the survival of cStage IIB was better than those of IB and IIA, while the survival curves were almost identical between cStage IIIc and IV. Also, the survival curve of pStage IIB was better than that of IIA, and the survival of pStage IV was better than that of IIIC. pStage IV in the UICC system included the patients with supraclavicular lymph-node metastasis (M1 LYM), which is probably the reason for the better prognosis of pStage IV than pStage IIIC.
We hope that this Comprehensive Registry of Esophageal Cancer in Japan 2014 will help to improve all aspects of the diagnosis and treatment of esophageal cancer in Japan.
