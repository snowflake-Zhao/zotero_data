The Cover
The cover represents each of the five major areas of genome science covered in the text. DNA sequencing and the study of genomic variation are represented by the white letters in the form of a normal distribution. These white letters spell out "A Primer of Genome Science" in codons corresponding to the single-letter amino acid abbreviations. The red, yellow, and green spots derive from a stylized image of a gene expression microarray, based on Illumina bead technol ogy. The radiating lines connecting spots with similar colors represent an interaction network such as can be inferred using proteomics and investigated by computational genomicists.

Preface
This book is an introduction to genom e science intended for senior under graduates or for graduate students w ho are new to the field. Eight years ago, w e were inspired to write this text as a result of our experiences teach ing introductory graduate classes in functional genom ics (GG) and bioin formatics (SM) at North Carolina State University. The general features of the field of genome science seem to have settled dow n around genome-scale sequencing, analysis of variation, gene expression profiling, proteomics, and metabolomics. Increasingly, computational biology and statistical analysis play a central role in genome research, and w e endeavor to capture this trend toward a merger of molecular and theoretical biology. Another major theme is that genom e research is not restricted to human biology or just a hand ful of biomedical m odel organisms: agricultural, ecological, behavioral and evolutionary genom ics are emerging as dynamic subdisciplines. By com bining the basics of bioinformatics and experimental methods in one text, we hope to encourage students to develop a familiarity with genom ics that will be useful whether they pursue careers in science, law, journalism, mar keting, or wherever their interests may lead. This third edition follow s the same sequence and style as the second edition, but includes substantial revisions that reflect som e dramatic tech nological innovations that became integral components of contemporary genom e analysis in 2007 and 2008. These are most notable in relation to genom e sequencing and "NextGen" resequencing (Chapter 2), wholegenom e genotyping and genome-wide association studies (Chapter 3), and commercial gene chips and bead arrays for whole-transcriptome pro filing (Chapter 5). We have included several new illustrations to help explain these advances and have discarded a surprising number of meth ods that are now obsolete. Chapter 6 has been updated to include som e exciting new developments in the field of metabolomics (also known as metabonomics) and systems biology.


PREFACE
♦♦
XII
The exercises associated with each chapter are for the most part the same as in the previous edition, as are the Boxes that explain statistical and bioinformatic principles. Regrettably, w e have found that many of the Web links mentioned in the text becom e inactive or m ove to new addresses with a half-life of a couple of years—which is also the time it takes the major genom e databases to overhaul their content and appearance. There is little we can do about this continual metamorphosis, and w e apologize to stu dents in advance for the frustration it will surely cause them. Without a doubt new methods and concepts will arise as soon as this book appears in print, if not sooner; such is the frenetic pace of genomics. We hope, howev er, that this edition at least captures the major trends of the past few years. We assume that the reader is familiar with the content of typical "300 level" undergraduate courses in genetics, and so have eschewed an open ing chapter that introduces basic concepts and terminology such as exons and introns, enhancers, cDNA, the central dogma, and the chromosomal basis of inheritance. Most readers will probably benefit from having a copy of a standard genetics text available for reference, and som e will wish to graduate quickly to any of the many detailed treatments of the main topics covered in single chapters of this book. We recognize that students will com e to the discipline with vastly dif ferent educational backgrounds. Som e will know how to program neural networks but be unaware of the distinction between SNPs and indels; some will have used microarrays but never have heard of a mapping function, let alone a Markov chain. Our strategy is to describe the core experimental methods side-by-side with the analytical approaches. We emphasize throughout the importance of statistics and analysis in the design and interpretation of genom ic data. Some readers will undoubted ly be frustrated by our decision not to concentrate on the biological impact of genom ic data, but that decision was made for tw o reasons. The first is that there is so much in flux that such coverage w ould be prema ture; the second is that this task is best left to individual teachers, w ho can put their ow n emphasis on the field in the context of class discussions. In addition to the exercises in the text, som e much more complicated exercises involving large datasets are provided online. Use of the internet is an essential part of instruction in genomics, which also depends on computers for laboratory information management, database establish ment, data sharing, and statistical analysis. Consequently, the Web site for this book provides, am ong other things, a series of related DNA sequence, microarray, and SNP datasets that can be dow nloaded and analyzed at will. The descriptive titles for these exercises can be found at the conclu sions of Chapters 2 through 5. In the final analysis, there is no substitute for reading the primary lit erature. It is unlikely that an undergraduate course will cover all of the topics, or that m ost graduate instructors will want to. This Primer is not meant to be used as a reference so much as an aid, in conjunction with classroom instruction, for the building of a foundation from which forays can be made into specific topics, from psychogenom ics to motif detection.

from com parison of genom e sequences to m odeling metabolism. There are undoubtedly topics we have m issed and som e discussions that will be out of date before long. But given an understanding of the basic approaches in genom e science, there is no reason w hy these cannot be explored independently. It has been our opinion that genom ics is too broad a topic to be accom modated by sim ply adding a chapter to standard textbooks. Furthermore, to d o so misses the central reality that the view of biology is different from the perspective of the w hole genom e as opposed to that from individual genes. We imagine that som e students drawn to the genom ic way of doing biology will seek to incorporate mathematics and computer science into their research from the beginning of their training, while others will seek to integrate classical molecular genetics and cell b iology into their work. If this book helps make both of these tasks easier, it will have done its job.
Acknowledgments
We w ould both like to acknowledge the contributions of our students in helping to bring the structure of this book together, as well as the input from instructors w ho have used the Primer in their classes over the years. A num ber of colleagues reviewed and otherwise helped shape specific chapters, including Lisa Goering, Trisha Wittkopp, Erika Zimmerman, David Pollock, Sergey Nuzhdin, Steven Carr, David Bird, Dahlia Nielsen, Matt Rockman, Greg Wray, Andy Clark, Patricia Hurban, Alison Motsinger-Reif, and sev eral anonymous reviewers (none of whom, of course, bears any responsi bility for errors of omission or commission). Greg Gibson w ould particu larly like to thank Walter Gehring, David Hogness, Cathy Laurie, Trudy Mackay, and Julian Adams, w ho helped build scaffolds and bridge gaps. Spencer Muse adds his special appreciation to Bruce Weir for a decade of guidance and advice. It was an absolute pleasure w orking with S. Mark Williams at Pyramis Studios in Durham, NC, w ho created the artwork for the first two edi tions, and with Jack Haley, w ho did the new illustrations in this edition. Both rendered the figures with care and creativity. Andy Sinauer, Carol Wigg, Chris Small, Janice Holabird, Jefferson Johnson, Susan McGlew, and everyone else at Sinauer Associates make writing a textbook a pleas ure, and their efficiency and enthusiasm quickly turn possibilities into reality. Finally, w e thank our wives, Diana and Cindy, from the bottom of our hearts, for understanding and so much more. Sydney, Paddington, Marcy, Quinn, Cooper, Incense, Calvin, Bernie, and Oliver played their support ing roles superbly as well.

t Genome Projects: .1 Organization and
Objectives
G
enom e science is the study of the structure, content, and evolution of genomes. Initially driven by high-volume nucleotide sequencing, technological advances have enabled the field to grow rapidly, and genom e science, or "genom ics," n ow also encom passes analysis of the expression and function of both genes and proteins. The related disciplines of bioinformatics and computational biology are increasingly integrated with empirical analyses. Genome projects are now in place for well over 300 different organisms. This chapter provides an overview of these projects as well as an introduction to som e of the central concepts in genome science.
The Core Aims o f Genome Science
All genom e projects share a com m on set of aims, subsets of which are emphasized according to available resources, economic and scientific goals, and the biological attributes of the organism under study. The major aims of individual genom e projects are:
1. To establish an integrated Web-based database and research interface. Access to the enormous volume of data generated by genome researchers is facilitated by ever-evolving Web interfaces. Many Web sites initially grew out of the efforts of a small group of leaders at a single research institution, but such sites quickly demand millions of dollars for upkeep and innovation, leading to the creation of mirror sites and organizations dedicated to collecting and linking data, to quality control, and to pre senting data in a useful manner. Rather than merely serving as storage bins for sequence and other data, most sites are now built on state-of-theart relational databases. Many of these utilize a common resource of inno vative software for data searches and online analysis.


2 CHAPTER 7
2. To assem ble physical and genetic maps of the genome. The location of genes in a genom e can be specified both according to physical distance and relative position defined by recombination frequencies. This infor mation is crucial for comparing the genom es of related species and for putting together phenotypic and genetic data. Genetic maps are used in animal and plant breeding, and in numerous areas of basic biological research. The art of map making has been honed by geneticists for the better part of a century, but genomicists are extending it to more and more species, with greater and greater accuracy.
3. To generate and order genom ic and expressed gene sequences. Highvolume sequencing is one of the defining features of genome science. The basic procedure used is the same one developed by Fred Sanger two decades ago, except that it has been heavily automated both at the levels of running reactions and reading sequences. Sequencing of whole genomes is now generally performed in a "shotgun" fashion: millions of short pieces of DNA sequence are computationally assembled into contigs, scaffolds, and eventually whole chromosomes. The term contig refers to a set of sequence fragments that have been ordered into a contiguous, linear stretch on the basis of sequence overlaps at the fragment ends. A set of contigs constitutes the scaffold of a whole-genome sequence. Because much of a genom e consists of noncoding DNA, genomicists are also interested in sequencing large numbers of cDNA clones. Such sequences are cloned from mRNA transcripts (see Chapter 2) and thus identify expressed genes and exon boundaries. Only one end of a cDNA need be sequenced to identify a clone, and these fragments are called expressed sequence tags, or ESTs. Because of alternative splicing and errors in the construction of cDNA libraries, there is not a one-to-one cor respondence between ESTs and genes, but EST collections are thought to give a go od first approximation of the diversity of genes expressed in a tissue.
4. To identify and annotate the com plete set of genes encoded within a genome. Having the complete sequence of a genome is only the first step toward characterizing its gene content. The genes encoded within the sequence must then be identified using a combination of experimental and bioinformatic strategies. These include alignment of cDNA and genomic sequences, looking for sequences that are similar to those already identified in other genom es (both of these procedures rely on DNA align ment and com parison algorithms such as BLAST), and applying gene finding software that recognizes DNA features that are associated with genes, such as open reading frames (ORFs), transcription start and ter mination sites, and exon/intron boundaries. Once a gene has been iden tified, it must be annotated, which entails linking its sequence to genetic data about the function, expression, and mutant phenotypes of the pro tein associated with the locus, as well as to comparative data from homol ogou s proteins in other species.


GENOME PROJECTS: ORGANIZATION AND OBJECTIVES 3
5. To characterize DN A sequence diversity. It has been known for som e time that all genom es are full of polymorphisms: sequence sites at which two or more variants are found in natural populations. Single-nucleotide polym orphism s are called SNPs, and it is generally assumed that most quantitative genetic variation—that is, the heritable component of vari ation in characters such as size, shape, yield, and disease susceptibilityshould be traceable to SNPs or to insertion/deletion polymorphisms. Characterization of the distribution of SNPs is a crucial first step in efforts to find associations between SNP variation and phenotypic variation. Another fundamentally important quantity that remains to be character ized is the level of haplotype structure due to linkage disequilibrium (LD). A haplotype is a set of adjacent polymorphism s found on a single chromosome, while LD refers to nonrandom associations between sites. The farther apart tw o sites are, the more they tend to assort independ ently (i.e., randomly), but there is great variation in the distances involved, from tens of bases to tens of kilobases. Disease locus mapping now generally utilizes detailed knowledge of LD. Further, SNP variation, along with variation in repetitive sequences such as microsatellites, can be an invaluable tool for inferring relationships between individuals, in forensics, in evolutionary studies of the history of a species, and in stud ies of population structure.
6. To com pile atlases of gene expression. Important clues to gene function can be gleaned from analyzing profiles of transcription and protein syn thesis. Traditional methods for characterizing gene expression include Northern blots and in situ hybridization (and, where an antibody exists. Western blots and immimohistochemistry). Genomic methods aim to con trast the expression of thousands of genes simultaneously. EST sequenc ing and serial analysis o f gene expression (SAGE) rely on the detec tion of transcript tags in libraries of cDNA fragments. These are being displaced by new high-throughput, "next-generation" sequencing of tens of millions of fragments. Such methods are used to contrast gene expres sion in different tissues, at different stages of development or infection, or in the presence of toxins and other environmental agents. Transcription profiling is used to compare gene expression across multiple treatments or conditions. A microarray is a collection of gene probes that have been spotted onto a glass slide or synthesized as oligon ucleotides on a silicon chip or collection of beads. These are hybridized to fluorescently labeled cDNA, and the relative intensity of signals between samples provides a measure of the abundance of each transcript. Analysis of gene expression profiles provides informa tion about the regulation of transcription, can yield clues to gene func tion, and may identify biomarkers for disease processes. Gene expres sion is also a pow erful tool in the identification of candidate genes and genetic pathways for any given process, since a gene must (usually) be expressed in a tissue in order to have an effect on it.


4 CHAPTER 7
7. To accumulate functional data, including biochem ical and phenotypic properties of genes. The term functional genom ics refers to a panoply of approaches under development to ascertain the biochemical, cellular, and/or physiological properties of each and every gene product. These include near-saturation mutagenesis (screening hundreds of thousands of mutants to identify genes that affect traits as diverse as embryogenesis, immunology, and behavior), high-throughput reverse genetics (methods to systematically and specifically inactivate individual genes), and elabora tion of genetic tools. Proteomics, a core element in functional genomics, includes methods for detecting protein expression and for detecting pro tein-protein interactions. Another subfield, structural genomics, seeks to elucidate the tertiary structure of each class of protein found in cells. Pharm acogenom icists are particularly interested in studying the interactions between small molecules (i.e., potential drugs) and proteins, both in vitro and in the context of living organisms. Research on m odel organisms such as mice, fruitflies, nematodes, various plants, and yeast is a crucial com ponent of functional genomics.
8. To provide the resources for com parison with other genomes. Just as nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution, nothing in genom ics makes sense except in the light of comparative data. Com parative maps allow genetic data from one species to be used in the analy sis of another, because local gene order along a chrom osome tends to be conserved over millions of years— a phenom enon known as synteny. Even without synteny, the conservation of gene function is n ow known to be extensive enough that studies of the genetics of neuronal signal ing or heart development in fruit flies can tell us much about the same processes in a primate. The development of online resources is being pri oritized in order to enhance an individual researcher's ability to use data being generated anywhere in the world, from any organism.
This chapter will describe the core elements of each of these objectives for the major genom e projects in animals, plants, and microbes of medical, agri cultural, and basic biological interest. Before doing so, it is essential to define the concepts of physical and genetic maps, as these two resources are cen tral to all of genom e science.
M apping Genomes
Genetic Maps
A genetic map is a description of the relative order of genetic markers in linkage groups in which the distance between markers is expressed as units of recombination. The genetic markers are most often physical attributes of the DNA (such as single-nucleotide polymorphisms, simple repeats, or variable restriction enzyme sites), but may include phenotypes associated with Mendelian loci. In diploid organisms, genetic maps are typically assem bled from data on the co-segregation of genetic markers either in pedigrees


GENOME PROJECTS: ORGANIZATION AND OBJECTIVES 5
or in the progeny of controlled crosses. The standard unit of genetic distance is the centiM organ (cM), an expression of the percentage of progeny in which a recombination event has occurred between two markers. Named for Thomas Hunt Morgan, 1 cM is an arbitrary unit equivalent to a recom bination frequency of 0.01. In human autosomal euchromatin, 1 cM is approximately 1,000 kb, which is twice as lon g as the equivalent parame ter for Drosophila. While there is a high variance, individual chrom osom es in many ani mal species tend to be on the order of 100 cM in length, indicating that one crossover occurs per chromosome per generation. Markers on different chro m osom es have a 50-50 chance of co-segregating, and thus are 50 cM apartwhich is the threshold for assigning markers to the same linkage group. Two markers that recombine 50% of the time may nevertheless be on the same linkage group, so long as they are joined by a third marker that shows less than 50% recombination with each of the markers (Figure 1.1). With suffi cient markers, the number of linkage groups and the number of chrom o som es should be the same for any given organism.

(B) The genotypes of multiple molecular or phenotypic markers in the recombinant individuals are determined, from which a table showing the frequency of recombinants between each marker is drawn up. (C) Software is then used to calculate the most likely genetic map from the data. In this hypothetical example, two linkage groups are inferred, one of which (top) is longer than 50 cM. The best estimate of the genetic distance in cM between each pair of markers is indicated on the right. Genetic maps can be assembled from pedigree data using similar principles.


6 CHAPTER 7
Software for the assembly of genetic maps is freely available from a num ber of sources (see http://linkage.rockefeller.edu/soft/list.html for a com prehensive listing of genetic analysis software), perhaps the most popular of which is the Mapmaker/QTL program (Lander et al. 1987). Linkage data are converted to map distances by virtue of a m apping function that adjusts for the observation that the probability of crossovers leading to recombi nation does not increase linearly with physical distance. The two most com m on m apping functions bear the names of their developers, Haldane and Kosambi. The Kosambi mapping function also adjusts for the phenomenon of interference, whereby the presence of one crossover reduces the likeli hood of another crossover in the vicinity. Multiple factors affect the correspondence between physical and genetic distances, including the variability of recombination rate along a chromo some (in most species, centromeres and telomeres are less recombinogenic than general euchromatin); genom e-wide recombination rate variation within and between species; gain and loss of repetitive DNA; and the low resolution of genetic maps due to small sample sizes of progeny used to establish linkage. Several methods have em erged for generating precise genetic maps in humans and most model organisms:
•Recombinant inbred lines (RIL) are collections of highly inbred lines gen erated by sib-mating or selfing of individual lines derived from the cross of a pair of genetically divergent inbred parents. RIL have proven partic ularly useful in mapping plant genomes. Seed for each line can be stored and disseminated to large numbers of workers, w ho are able to add mark ers to the existing maps at will.
•Construction of human, mouse, and many other vertebrate genetic maps has been greatly facilitated by the development of radiation hybrid (RH) mapping, in which fragments of chromosomes from the organism of study are incorporated into a panel of hamster fibroblast cell cultures (Deloukas et al. 1998). Species-specific PCR amplification is then used to ascertain which loci are present in each line, and the frequency with which mark ers co-segregate is an indicator of the physical distance between the mark ers. There is no need for the markers to be polymorphic in the species under study. Mapping functions unique to RIL and RH mapping have been devel oped that allow precise ordering of loci, as well as comparison with phys ical data.
•Single-sperm typing is a PCR-based method for actually counting the number of crossovers between two markers, with the potential to accu rately define recombination fractions as small as 0.001 over just tens of kilobases. Evidence is emerging that there is variation in the distribution of crossovers along a gene, so that recombination may be focused on hotspots that could have a major effect on the structure of polymorphism (Jeffreys et al. 2004).


GENOME PROJECTS: ORGANIZATION AND OBJECTIVES 7
EXERCISE 1.1 Constructing a genetic map
Suppose that a breeder o f orange trees begins to assemble a genetic m ap based on four recessive loci— thickskin, reddish, sour, and petite— nam ed after the fruit phenotypes o f hom ozygotes. After identifying two truebreeding trees that are either com pletely wild-type or are mutant for all four loci, the breeder crosses them and plants an orchard o f the resultant F2 trees. Based on the following frequencies o f mutant classes, determine which loci are likely to be on the sam e chrom osom e and which are the m ost closely linked.
Normal 402 Thick 18 Petite 127 Red, sour, and petite 12 Sour 115 Red 11 Thick and red 108 Thick and petite 10 Thick, red, and petite 42 Thick, red, sour, and petite 8 Thick, red, and sour 41 Thick and sour 7 Sour and petite 38 Red and petite 3 Red and sour 24 Thick, sour, and petite 2
ANSWER: First confirm that each mutant segregates with approximately Mendelian ratios by adding up the total number o f each phenotype. Onequarter o f the total number o f 968 trees, or around 242, should show each recessive phenotype. This seem s to be the case, since there are 242 petite, 249 reddish, 247 sour, a n d 236 thickskin orange-producing trees. Given these ratios, we would expect that unlinked loci would segregate independ ently, such thatjust 60 or so trees (V4x 1/4 x 968) produce each double mutant class, but that com pletely linked loci would produce close to 240 double mutants. Adding the actual numbers o f double mutants produced gives the following results:
Thickandred 199 Thick and petite 62 Thickandsour 58 Red and petite 65 Red and sour 85 Sour and petite 60
These numbers indicate that the thickskin and reddish loci are quite close ly linked, and that the reddish and sour loci are also probably linked, though less closely than thickskin and reddish. Since thickskin and sour appear to segregate independently, the reddish locus must lie between them. Petite m aps to a different linkage group.
•Recombination rates can also be estimated indirectly from population genetic data, using advanced statistical algorithms to analyze the pat tern of variation in the level of linkage disequilibrium along a locus in a population of sequences (McVean et al. 2004).


8 CHAPTER 1
Physical Maps
A physical map is an assembly of contiguous stretches of chrom osom al DNA— contigs—in which the distance between landmark sequences of DNA is expressed in kilobases. The ultimate physical map is the complete DNA sequence, which allows physical distances to be defined in nucleotides, notwithstanding variance among individuals due to insertion/deletion polymorphisms. Physical maps provide a scaffold upon which anonymous polymorphic markers can be placed, thereby facilitating finer scale linkage mapping; they confirm linkages inferred from recombination frequencies, and resolve ambiguities about the order of closely linked loci; they enable detailed comparisons of regions of colinearity between genomes; and they can be a first step in the assembly of a complete genom e sequence. Two general strategies can be used to assemble contigs:
1. Alignment of randomly isolated clones based on shared restriction fragment length profiles. Clones range in size from 1,000s of kilobases (yeast artifi cial chromosomes, YACs) to 100s of kilobases (bacterial artificial chromo som es [BACs], or PI clones) to kilobases (plasmid or bacteriophage clones). Restriction profiling (see Figure 2.10) has been automated using a combination of robotics, which reduces human error while increasing throughput, and continually improving software for efficient analysis of profiles. DNA fragments that have been separated by gel electrophore sis and visualized using standard dyes are im aged digitally, then placed in size bins chosen to optimize resolution and facilitate probabilistic com parison of profiles.
2. Hybridization-based approaches. In these techniques, a com m on probe is used to identify which of an arrayed set of clones are likely to be contigu ous. In ch rom osom e walking, a series of adjacent clones are isolated using the terminal sequence of one clone as a probe to identify a set of overlapping clones that share the probe sequence. One of these is then chosen to identify a new terminal probe for the second step (Figure 1.2), and so forth. The extent of overlap of sets of clones identified by hybridization is also determined by com paring the restriction enzyme profiles of each clone. Contigs can be extended by end-sequencing par ticular clones, leading to the identification of sequence-tagged sites (STSs), which in turn can be used as hybridization probes to either extend the chrom osome walk or fill in gaps in the contig. The assembly of con tigs and even whole genom e physical maps is discussed in Chapter 2.
Cytological Maps
One historically prevalent aid in the alignment of physical and genetic maps is the use of cytological maps, as shown in Figure 1.3. Cytological maps are the banding patterns observed through a m icroscope on stained chrom o some spreads. Traditional cytological preparations have included the sali vary gland polytene chrom osomes of insects and Giemsa-banded mam malian metaphase karyotypes. The demonstration that certain mutant

phenotypes or medical conditions correlate with the deletion or rearrange ment of chromosome sections provided some of the first evidence that chro m osom es are the genetic material, and human karyotype mapping remains a vital tool in diagnosing a range of human disorders. In situ hybridization of cloned DNA fragments to the chrom osom es allows alignment with the physical map as well. Human chromosomes are divided into bands, with numbering on the small (petite, p) and long (nonpetite, q) arms from the centromere to the telomere, giving rise, for exam ple, to the nomenclature that yields 7pl5 as the signifier for the location of the Hox com plex in the m iddle of the short arm of chrom osome 7. Genome browsers give researchers a w ide range of options for the visual display of cytological, physical, and genetic map data.

melanogaster. Genetic (bottom), cytological (middle), and physical (top) maps can be
aligned. The physical map includes the location of transcripts and sites of insertions and deletions as determined by standard molecular biology. Since recombination rates vary along a chromosome, typically being reduced near the telomere and centromere, distances between genetic, physical, and cytological markers are not uniform.
Comparative Genomics
In genomic parlance, the term synteny refers to the conservation of gene order between chrom osome segments of two or more organisms. Physical maps provide the most direct means for characterizing the extent of synteny, because highly conserved loci that can confidently be regarded as hom ologs (that is, derived from a common ancestral locus) provide anchoring landmarks. H ow ever, appropriate phylogenetic methods (discussed in Chapter 2)must be used to distinguish true homologs—properly known as orthologs—from paralogs, which are similar genes that arose as a result of duplication in one or both lin eages subsequent to an evolutionary split. In many cases, entire complexes of genes have undergone multiple rounds of duplication, which complicates efforts to distinguish orthology from paralogy. The distinction is not just of academic interest; it can be crucial when comparative physical maps are used to suggest the location of a locus with medical or other phenotypic effects based on its linkage to a cluster of syntenic loci. The extent of conservation of gene order is an inverse function of time since divergence from the ancestral locus, since chromosomal rearrangement is required to break up linkages. Rates of divergence vary considerably at all taxonomic levels. A notable example is the Japanese pufferfish, Fugu rubripes. Chosen for study largely on the basis of its unusually small genom e size for a vertebrate (7.5 times smaller than the human genome), Fugu appears to have achieved this state by virtue of extensive DNA loss accompanied by rearrangements that probably shortened the average length of syntenic regions (Aparicio et al. 2002). Fugu and humans have a similar number of genes, and even short blocks of synteny are usually disrupted by the inser


GENOME PROJECTS: ORGANIZATION AND OBJECTIVES 11
tion of one or more genes between the conserved ones. Monocotyledenous grasses and dicotyledenous plant species also retain segments of conserved gene order, covering hundreds of kilobases, that are likely to be com m on to all plants (Mayer et al. 2001),but extensive gene duplication, gene loss, and local rearrangement disrupts synteny and complicates efforts to use compar ative physical maps to clone genes of interest (Delseny 2004). Chromosome fusions and splits, reciprocal translocations, and inversions all contribute to rearrangement of gene order (Ferguson-Smith and Trifonov 2007). Within the great apes, each chrom osome is thought to have experi enced an average of two or three rearrangements, many of which can be observed directly in karyotypes inferred from the banding patterns of mitotic chromosome spreads. This method has been enhanced dramatically by the developm ent of the chrom osom e painting technique (Figure 1.4),

the 24 human chromosomes (22 autosomes plus the two sex chromosomes; lavender) are aligned against color-coded representations of corresponding cat chromosomes, as determined by a combination of FISH and RH mapping. Cat chromosomes are assigned to six groups (A-F) of 2-4 chromosomes each.

in which each chrom osome of one species is separately labeled with a set of fluorescent dyes that produce a unique hue, and hybridized to chromosome spreads of the other genome. Chromosome painting has been used to define regions of synteny covering segments of the order of one-tenth of a chro m osom e arm between d o g or cat and human (Figure 1.5; Murphy et al. 2000). In addition to anchoring sequence scaffolds to cytological maps, this method is an important component of efforts to perform comparative map ping of species for which well-resolved physical maps are unavailable. High-resolution comparative physical m apping has show n that even within megabase-long stretches of synteny between human and mouse that may contain hundreds of genes, local inversions and insertions/deletions involving one or a few genes may not be uncommon. Families of genes organized in tandem clusters are particularly likely to diverge in number, organization, and coding content between species (Dehal et al. 2001). Break points between syntenic blocks often also harbor local duplicated segments of DNA, though it is not clear whether these are the cause of, or occur in conjunction with, genom ic rearrangements (Bailey et al. 2004). Consider able size variation in intergenic "junk" DNA is also apparent.

The Human Genome Project
Genome science originated with a set of objectives conceived primarily to facilitate molecular biological research. With technological advances and increased involvement of private industry, the pursuit of these objectives emerged as a discipline in its ow n right. Historians and philosophers of sci ence will undoubtedly debate the relationship between the acquisition of information versus knowledge, and critics w ill continue to lament the absence of hypothesis-driven research in genomics, but the field is unique in having a clearly defined set of criteria by which its impact can be judged. By the objective criteria of goal attainment, the Human Genome Project in particular has been one of the most successful publicly funded scientific endeavors in history. In the remainder of this chapter w e explore its objec tives and achievements, as well as those of mouse, invertebrate, plant, and microbial genom e projects.
Objectives
The objectives of the publicly funded Human G enom e Project (HGP) were established in a series of 5-year plans authored by leading figures of the U.S. National Institutes of Health and Department of Energy research planning groups (Collins and Galas 1993; Collins et al. 1998, 2003). These objectives are summarized in Tables 1.1 and 1.2and can be found on the HGP Web site http://www.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/home.shtml. Most of the goals of the first and second plans were achieved ahead of time and under budget, including completion of the first-draft human genom e sequence. Achievements beyond those originally included in the plans, such as the emergence of structural genom ics and association m apping of dis ease loci, will help shape the discipline over the next decade. The initial objectives of the HGP can be summarized briefly as follows. First, the generation of high-resolution genetic and physical maps that have becom e an invaluable com ponent of efforts to localize disease-associated genes. Second, the attainment of sequence benchmarks, leading to genera tion of a complete genom e sequence by the year 2005. (Two draft versions were achieved in 2000, one by privately and one by publicly financed ini tiatives, but completion of the "finished" sequence—namely, an error rate of less than 1in 10,000 nucleotides— of each chromosome took several more years.) Third, identification of each and every gene in the genom e by a com bination of bioinformatic identification of open reading frames (ORFs), gen eration of volum inous expressed sequence tag (EST) databases, and colla tion of functional data including comparative data from other animal genome projects. Andfourth, compilation of exhaustive polymorphism data bases, in particular of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), to facilitate integration of genom ic and clinical data, as well as studies of human diver sity and evolution.

The fifteen grand challenges listed in Table 1.2 range from elucidation of the structure of genetic networks through prediction of susceptibility to disease to the development of policy options for ensuring equal access to the benefits of genom e research.
The Content of the Human Genome
Completion of the first draft of the human genome sequence was announced at a press conference in May of 2000, but publication of this milestone was delayed until February of 2001 (IHGSC 2001; Venter et al. 2001). The inter vening months were used to initiate a phase of refinement of the sequence assembly, including gap closure and verification of am biguous aspects.


GENOME PROJECTS: ORGANIZATION AND OBJECTIVES 17
along with gene annotation and prediction. The published draft genome fell well short of a definitive statement of the total gene content of the human genome, primarily because identifying coding sequences within random higher eukaryotic DNA sequences is not a trivial process. Estimates of the number of genes in the human genome initially ranged from a low of 30,000 to in excess of 120,000genes. The current estimate centers around a consen sus figure of 22,000 genes (IHGSC 2004). This figure is not much greater than the gene content of two invertebrate multicellular eukaryotes—the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and the nem atode w orm Caenorhabditis elegans— and is less than four times greater than that of a unicellular eukaryote, the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Table 1.3). Much of the increase in size can be attributed to two rounds of wholegenom e duplication, although independent expansion of certain gene fam ilies is also apparent. The complement of metabolic enzymes is essentially no different from that of other eukaryotes, while the numbers of genes involved in regulatory functions such as transcription, signal transduction, and intercellular signaling has expanded in proportion to the whole genome increase. Further analyses have confirmed that there are no dramatic differ ences in gene content between humans and other mammals, such as the mouse; in fact the human genom e is notable for a reduction in som e gene classes, such as olfactory receptors. The first high-resolution genetic map of the com plete human genom e was published in September of 1994. This map established the existence of 23 linkage groups (one per chromosome) with 1,200 markers at an average of 1 cM intervals (Gyapay et al. 1994). This map was quickly followed by a physical map generated from 52,000 sequence tag sites (STS) at approxi mately 60 kb intervals that form ed the scaffold for the top-down public sequencing effort (Hudson et al. 1995). A database of 30,000 expressed sequence tags, initially thought to represent the first collection of unique genes, was reported by Adams et al. in 1995, and several commercial con sortia were also assembling orders-of-magnitude greater EST databases by that time. A collection of more than 3,000 SNPs was described by Wang et al. in 1998,but by 2004 this figure had exceeded 1.8million mapped SNPsin essence providing polymorphic markers at 2kb intervals and placing 85%

BOX 1.1 The Ethical, Legal, and Social Implications
of the Human Genome Project
The ELSI Program was established in
January of 1990 after a combined working
group of the National Institutes of Health
and the Department of Energy recommend
ed that research and education relating to
the ethical, legal, and social implications of
human genome research be incorporated as
an essential component of the entire project
from its inception. The National Human
Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) now
commits 5% of its annual budget to ELSI,
funding three types of activity: regular R01
research grants, R25 education grants, and
intramural programs at the NIH campus
in Bethesda, Maryland. Web sites describ
ing the program can be found at http://
www.genome.gov/10001618 and http://
www.oml.gov/sci/techresources/Human_
Genome/research/elsi.html, the latter doc
umenting activities funded by the DOE.
The original mission statement of the
project had four major objectives:
•Anticipation of the implications for indi
viduals and society of sequencing the
human genome. •Examination of the ethical, legal, and
social implications of obtaining the
sequence. •Stimulation of public discussion of the
issues. •Development of policy options that
would ensure beneficial use of HGP
information.
More practically, research is centered
around four main subject areas:
•Privacy and fairness in the use and inter
pretation of genetic information (by
insurers, employers, courts, schools,
adoption agencies, and the military,
among others). •Clinical integration of new genetic tech
nologies. •Issues relating to design and implemen
tation of clinical research, including con
sent, participation, and reporting. •Public and professional education.
One pressing social and individual issue
that has attracted wide attention and gen
erated great concern is the privacy and
confidentiality of genetic information. This
topic is particularly prominent in countries
such as Iceland and Estonia, where govern
ment-sponsored databases of medical
records (including both genetic histories
dating back centuries and newly obtained
genotype data) have been supplied to med
ical research companies. Another area of
concern is the psychological impact and
potential for stigmatization inherent in the
generation of genetic data, particularly in
the context of racial mistrust and socioeco
nomic differences in gathering of and
access to genetic information. Reproductive
issues can arise relating to informed con
sent and the rights of parents to know ver
sus their fear of knowing, as well as poten
tial moral (and possibly even legal) obliga
tions once data has been obtained.
The program works toward implement
ing clear and uniform standards for
informed consent and the conduct of clini
cal research, against a backdrop of federal
reluctance to regulate and public uncer
tainty about the new technology. Another
goal is the education of self-help groups,
educators, and the media about distin
guishing between very complex statistical
associations and oversimplified assertions
about the nature-nurture debate, biological
determinism, and heritability.
Philosophical discussions cover issues
ranging from the basis of human responsi
bility, to the human right to "play God"
with genetic material, to the meaning of
free will in relation to genetically influ
enced behaviors.
In the more "practical" arena are studies
of economic, safety, and environmental
issues in relation to the release of genetical
ly modified organisms (GMOs) at a time
when public mistrust of science is increas
ing, particularly in Europe; the commercial
and legal issues associated with the patent
ing of genetic material, procedures, and
data, including international treaties and
obligations as well as the right to free
access to published data; and the forensic
implications of DNA profiles in legal issues
from paternity testing to the presumption
of innocence.


Web pages and documents providing
more detail on each of these issues can be
accessed through Web links at the ORNL
site. In addition, at least two major univer
sity institutes have established useful Web
sites relating to their involvement in the
ELSI project. The University of Kansas
Medical Center site (http://www.kumc.edu/
gec/prof/geneelsi.html) provides a series of
policy papers put out by the American
Society of Human Genetics and the
American College of Medical Genetics on
issues as diverse as fetal screening, cancer
testing, testing for late-onset psychological
disease, genetics and adoption, population
screening of at-risk populations, and
eugenics. It also provides an extensive set
of links to legislative acts dealing, for
example, with health insurance portability,
Americans with disabilities, and birth
defects prevention, as well as links to other
internet resources established by public
policy institutes and journals. Medical
genetics courses and education opportuni
ties, including the 30 or so genetic counsel
ing programs in the United States, are also

cerned with the development of education
al materials and is developing a series of
teaching modules on topics such as breast
cancer screening, genetic patents and intel
lectual property, and personal privacy and
medical databases.
In 1998, the ELSI Research Planning and
Evaluation Group issued a new set of goals
as part of the NHGRI reevaluation of the
future of the Human Genome Project. The
five new major aims are:
1. Examine issues surrounding the comple
tion of the human genome sequence and
the study of human genetic variation:
How will SNP mapping affect our
understanding of race and ethnic diver
sity? How can we balance individual
rights with ongoing research needs? Are
there new concerns relating to the com
mercialization of human genetics? and.
How can we best educate professionals
and the general public alike about the
implications of human genetic variation?
2. Examine issues raised by the integration
of genetic technologies and knowledge
into health care and public health activi
ties: Will genetic testing promote risky
behavior or intolerance? What are the
social implications of pharmacogenomics,
the tailoring of treatments for complex
conditions to genotype? Will genetic fac
tors be overemphasized merely because
they can be more objectively defined than
environmental ones? and. What will be
the impact of genomics on health care
provision and insurance issues, morbidity
and mortality, and reproductive behavior?
3. Examine issues raised by the integration
of knowledge about gene-environment
interactions in nonclinical settings: Are
there conditions under which genetic
testing should not be considered? What
issues are raised by the storage of blood
and other tissue samples by the military
and police, among other groups? What
legal issues arise in relation to adoption
and child custody, and are they affected
by prior exposure to cultural and envi
ronmental variables and pathogens? and.
Can we identify potential abuses of
genetic information in the workplace, in
classrooms, and by the media?
4. Explore interactions between new genetic
knowledge and philosophy, theology,
and sociology: Will our appreciation of
the place of humans in relation to other
living creatures change? What are the
implications of behavioral genetics for
traditional notions of self, responsibility,
and spirituality? and. Is lengthening the
human life span likely and/or desirable?
5. Explore how socioeconomic factors and
concepts of race and ethnicity influence
the use and interpretation of genetic
information, the utilization of genetic
services, and development of policy:
How are individual views about the
impact of genetics influenced by ethnic
and social factors? Will particular com
munities be more vulnerable to abuse or
more likely to benefit from genomics?
and. What are the most effective strate
gies to ensure that genetic counseling is
provided in a culturally sensitive and
relevant manner?

of all exons within 5 kb of a SNP. Today there are estimated to be in excess of 10million common SNPs, and the latest haplotype map (based on 3.1 mil lion SNPs genotyped in 270 individuals from Africa, Europe, and Asia) cap tures the vast majority of human genetic polymorphism (IHMC 2007). The first draft chrom osome sequence was also published in 2000 for the smallest human chromosome, chrom osome 21 (Hattori et al. 2000), and fin ished quality w hole chrom osom es were published at regular intervals between 2003 and 2007. New builds of the genom e sequence are updated on the public Web sites almost monthly, ensuring constant integration of the latest sequence information. One question that is often asked in relation to the content of the human genome is: Whose genome was sequenced? The answer is that the sequence was derived from a collection of several libraries obtained from a set of anony mous donors. In the mid 1990s, ethical concerns were raised over the ramifi cations of one individual contributing the complete sequence. The issue was resolved to general satisfaction by reconstructing the core libraries. Both the International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium (IHGSC) and the pri vate firm Celera Genomics reported that they assembled their sequence from multiple libraries of ethnically diverse individuals, although one particular individual's DNA contributed three-quarters and two-thirds of the raw sequence, respectively, as shown in Figure 1.7. Both groups adhered to strict privacy and consent guidelines when enrolling donors, whose identities remain unknown to researchers and are unavailable to the general public.* The IHGSC made initial libraries from individuals of both sexes but, as reported in their paper, by chance only males were used in the assembly of the first draft. The ethnic identity of the eight individuals w hose samples were included is unknown, since the final samples were chosen at random. By contrast, the Celera sample included at least one individual from each of four ethnic groups, as well as both males and females. Race is not regarded as a concern, both because ongoing genome diversity surveys have been far more informative with regard to identification of racial differences, and because it is w ell known that the overwhelm ing majority of human sequence variation is shared across the human races. Extensive tracts of heterochromatin, which may account for as much as 20% of the total genom e and are mostly located adjacent to the centromeres, will probably never be sequenced. Since the com pletion of the first draft, much of the sequencing focus of the HGP has been on characterizing human diversity. The International HapMap project (described in Chapter 3) is intended to map all of the major haplotypes in the human genom e and to characterize their distribution am ong populations, as a step toward identi fication of human disease susceptibility factors. Agencies in Canada, China,
*In May of 2002, J. Craig Venter admitted to CBS' 60 Minutes that in fact his own DNA con tributed substantially to the Celera sequence. A finished version of his diploid genome was published in September of 2007 (Levy et al. 2007). He and his then-wife, Claire Fraser, continued the family tradition by sequencing the genome of their poodle. Shadow, as the first draft canine genome sequence.

Japan, Nigeria, the United Kingdom, and the United States have developed a public resource (http://www.hapmap.org)that allows researchers around the w orld to access the latest information concerning the structure of vari ation in the human genome. Plans to generate 1,000 human genom e sequences from all over the w orld were announced in early 2008.


22 CHAPTER 1
EXERCISE 1.2 Use the NCBI a n d E nsem bl g e n o m e browsers to examine a human disease gene
Choose a human disease o f interest to you, and then use the OMIM site to identify a gene that is implicated in the etiology o f the disease. Then use the NCBI, UCSC, and Ensembl genom e browsers to answer the following ques tions about the gene:
a. What are the various identifiers (aliases) for your gene?
b. Where is the gene located on the chromosome (cytologically and physically)? c. What is the Reference Sequence (RefSeq) for the gene? d. How many exons are there in the major transcript, and how long is it? e. What is known about the function o f the gene? f. Do the three annotations agree? Which browser do you prefer, and why?
SAMPLE ANSWER: Go to http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov, click on OMIM, and type "asthma" into the search field. Scroll through the genes until you find one o f interest, for example lnterleukin-13 (1L13J, and click on the blue number (*147683). This will bring up a page with a lot o f textual informa tion, but you can also link out to various sites, including Entrez Gene, which tells you that the LocusID for IL13 is 3596 and that its cytological location is 5q31(chromosome 5, long arm, position 132.1 Mb). The gene is also called ALRH, BHR1,and P600. The RefSeq is NM_002188, an mRNA sequence. There appear to be four exons in the major transcript, which is 1,282 bp long and encodes a protein o f 146 amino acids, 34 o f which are for the sig nal peptide. The protein is an immunoregulatory cytokine that regulates B-cell maturation and differentiation and the inflammatory response in the presence o f allergens.
All o f this information can also be obtained by linking out to the Primary Source from the Human Genome Organization Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC: 5973), which links to the http://www.ensembl.org and http://genome.ucsc.edu pages. Alternatively, you can access these sites directly and search for the genes by typing "IL13" into the search engines. The Ensembl gene identifier is ENSGOOOOO169194, and the gene view indi cates that the transcript spans almost 3 kb. A number o f gene ontology functions are listed as well. The UCSC site displays polymorphisms and conservation plots as well as a large number o f other tracks.
Internet Resources
There are three major Web browsers for accessing genom e data: (1) the U.S. National Institute of Health's Entrez Life Sciences Search Engine; (2) the European Bioinformatics Institute's Ensembl Genome Browser; and (3) the


GENOME PROJECTS: ORGANIZATION AND OBJECTIVES 23
University of California at Santa Cruz's UCSC Genome Bioinformatics Site. Each of these is each built around the human genome, but all of them also provide comparable access to annotated genome sequences of a wide range of other species. Each of the major m odel organisms described later in this chapter also has dedicated browsers that include other attributes such as genetic data, literature links, and scientific images. Exercise 1.2provides an opportunity for you to compare these genome browsers. The Entrez site, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/gquery, is a service of the U.S. National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). There are now 26 core search pages that coordinate information relating to such topics as gene and mRNA sequences, proteins, gene expression, chemical screens, and polymorphism. The Human Genom e Resources site links to data and resources including a convenient map viewer and a tutorial with step-by-step instructions for various types of search. As of June 2008, there are 148 animal, 42plant, and 152protist or fungal genom es in various states of completion that can be viewed either by scrolling along a schematic chro m osom e map, by searching for sequence matches, or in m ost cases via a genom e resource page dedicated for a specific organism. The NIH (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov; Figure 1.8) also maintains GenBank and PubMed. GenBank is a genetic sequence database that provides an annotated collection of all genomic and cDNA sequences that are in the pub lic domain (Box 1.2; Benson et al. 2007). These can be searched using a pro gram called BLAST in subsets of the w hole database that include only nonredundant (NR) sequences; only highly curated reference sequences for well-described genes (RefSeq); expressed sequence tags (ESTs, short frag ments of cDNAs); genom e survey sequences (GSS, short reads of genomic DNA); HTGS (high-throughput genom ic sequences, corresponding to nonassembled reads of whole genomes); and assembled genomes. PubMed is a literature search engine providing access to all published medically related abstracts and journals, and PubMed Central is an open-source repos itory where all NIH-funded research papers must be made freely available within a year of publication. The Ensembl e! Browser (www.ensembl.org) is a joint project between the European Bioinformatics Institute (part of the European Molecular Biol ogy Organization) and the Sanger Institute in Cambridge, England, and is primarily funded by the Wellcome Trust (Bimey et al. 2004). There are at least 39 animal species represented, including such unusual characters as the platypus, lesser hedgehog, and Caribbean lizards. Most of the genome sequences are processed automatically through annotation pipelines, but the sequences of five species (human, mouse, zebrafish, pig, and dog) are highly annotated by manual curation at the VEGA (Vertebrate Genom e Annotation) database. Many users find the Ensembl interface friendlier than Entrez. A nice fea ture is a customizable hom e page that allows you to keep track of searches and brow sing over multiple sessions from different computers. BioMart is a tool for extracting and downloading user-specified aspects of the data in various formats suitable for high end bioinformatics analysis. Gene specific

searches are conducted directly from the hom e page by selecting your species of interest and then entering the gene name. The resulting page links out to various attributes and a ContigView map that allows you to browse the gene from chromosomal interval all the way to the sequence. The UCSC Genome Bioinformatics site (http://genome.ucsc.edu)includes a highly configurable browser that provides users with an immediate visu alization of hundreds of different genom e features (Kuhn et al. 2007). The main page asks you to select the "tracks" that you wish to display, and expe rienced researchers can also add their own tracks. These tracks are grouped into seven main categories of data plus another six categories relating to the ENCODE project (described in Chapter 2). Tracks can be hidden or dis played in short or expanded views. The categories are: m apping and sequencing; phenotype and disease association; genes and gene predictions; transcript evidence; gene expression data; comparative genomics; and sequence variation. These choices are displayed behind the main graphi cal display of a region of the genom e under consideration and can be updated at will. All of the data behind the tracks can be retrieved in text for

mat using the Table Browser. Sequence searches are performed using a pro gram called BLAT that looks for very high conservation in short 25 nucleotide blocks, rather than by alignment of the w hole query sequence, as in BLAST. Another original feature is the Gene Sorter, which provides a table of genes related to the query based on a number of attributes chosen by the researcher, such as sequence, expression, or functional similarity. Medical and clinical data is integrated with genom e data through the O nline M endelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) Web site (Figure 1.9), which grew out of an exhaustive catalog of human genetic disorders (McKusick 1998; Hamosh et al. 2000). OMIM is a searchable database that typically provides text summarizing recent genetic research in response to a query about a particular disease. This data is primarily intended for physicians and human geneticists, but a less technical "Genes and Disease" site also exists within the NCBI resource that compiles information according to dis ease types such as muscle, metabolism, cardiovascular, and psychological disorders. OMIM lists in excess of 19,000 entries, including 4,400 known Mendelian disorders, of which almost 2,800 are linked to genes. A major objective of the NCBI is to allow researchers in remote locations to be able both to submit their own data for inclusion in the grow ing data bases, or simply to query and search data submitted by others. Increasingly, software for performing com plex bioinformatic analyses is incorporated into Web sites so that virtual experiments can be conducted directly over the internet without the need to download voluminous databases. For exam ple, the GEO BLAST tool allows a researcher to search for all genes in the

BOX 1.2 GenBank Files
There are as many ways to present the struc
ture and annotation of a gene or sequence as
there are genomics-related Web sites. A basic
problem is that there is often no single cor
rect structure for a given gene, due to alter
nate splicing and transcription start sites,
errors that may occur during cloning, and
the fact that algorithms underlying gene
structure prediction software are imperfect.
Furthermore, all genomes are full of poly
morphism. Thus the same gene may be rep
resented by multiple different sequences or
annotations in the genome databases.
The National Center for Biotechnology
Information (NCBI) has adopted a policy of
accepting all sequences that are submitted to
GenBank, but has developed a standard
form of annotation that carries the implica
tion "user beware." Hand curation by
experts is required before any one sequence
is elevated to the status of "RefSeq," or Ref
erence Sequence; all other sequences should
be regarded as supporting evidence.
All Entrez nucleotide files in GenBank
share a number of features, which we illus
trate using the human HOXA1 file. Access
the file by typing the identifier 11421562 into
the search field (select "Nucleotide" in the
Entrez pulldown menu) at http://www.ncbi.
nlm.nih.gov, and then click on the accession
number (for example, XM_004915), which
will bring up the view shown below.
1. The top few lines define the locus,
including the length of the sequence;
whether the sequence is derived from
mRNA or genomic DNA; the date of
submission; the definition, including
the species from which the sequence
was obtained and the common name
of the gene; the complete taxonomic
classification of the organism; and the
source tissue.
2. This information is followed by the
reference, with the names of the
authors, the journal, and the title of
the article in which the sequence was
or will be published, and any histori
cal notes on updates that have been
submitted directly to the NCBI.
3. The meat of the file is the features sec
tion, which has subheadings describ
ing the known extent of the gene; the
coding sequence (CDS) including the
predicted protein sequence; and mis
cellaneous features (misc_feature)
such as intron-exon boundaries, iden
tified protein domains, variations.

mutations (if the sequence is derived
from a mutant strain), and alternate
transcripts. All of these are associated
with links—for example, to OMIM,
the HGNC GenelD page, or the PFAM
protein domain database file. Longer
sequence "scaffold files" span hun
dreds of kilobases (for example,
HOXA1 is contained within PAC file
AC_004079) and annotate each pre
dicted gene. Scaffold files also include
pointers to sequence-tagged sites, re
peats, and miscellaneous other fea
tures.
4. Next comes the sequence itself, in
blocks of 10bases, 60bases per row,
with a running tally of the site number
at the beginning of each row. Users
have the option of displaying the
sequence in FASTA format (which is
simply an uninterrupted sequence of
letters following a header) or down
loading it as a text file by clicking on
the "Display" and "Send to" boxes at
the top of the page. XML and ASN.l
files can be used to export the file to
certain bioinformatics applications.
For a thorough description of all the ele
ments of a sample GenBank record, see
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Sitemap/
samplerecord.html; an exhaustive descrip
tion of the features table is found at
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/collab/FT.
There are numerous ways to view the
structure of a gene graphically. Starting from
the GenBank nucleotide file, link out to the
EntrezGene file by clicking on the GenelD
(in this case 3198) link. This will display a
very low-resolution image of the transcripts
associated with the gene (in the case of
human HOXA1, two transcripts are seen).
Next, click the MapViewer link on the right
hand side of the GenelD page, which dis
plays various models of the gene in vertical
orientation and allows you to zoom in or out
along the chromosome. A highlighted set of
links point to sequence view (sv), protein
reports (pr), download (dl), evidence view
(ev), model maker (nun), homologene (hm),
and other pages.
Other databases and genome browsers
can be accessed directly from the HGNC
GenelD page; the link is found near the top
of the Entrez Gene page, on the line labeled
Primary Source. In the "Database Links"
section of the HGNC page one finds a link
to the Ensembl GeneView report, the top of
which is shown below. GeneView presents a
great deal of useful information on a single
page, including links to orthologs across
many species, transcript data, gene and pro
tein structure information, and graphical
representations of the gene. Also from the
HGNC Database Links one can reach the
UCSC Browser, which is particularly useful
for comparing alignments across multiple
mammals. In HGNC's "Gene Symbol
Links" section one finds GeneCards, a use
ful site that provides access to an ever grow
ing array of data about any particular gene.

gene expression database that have similar sequences, and then compare levels of expression of the genes across species and experimental conditions. Clearly, the utility of these resources is heavily dependent on the quality of the data they contain. Thus an important new area of bioinformatic research is the development of procedures for efficient database quality control.
Animal Genome Projects
The International Sequencing Consortium (ISC; http://www.intlgenome.org) maintains a database of animal and plant genom e sequencing projects sup ported mainly by funding agencies in the United States, England, France, Japan and Canada. In addition to the projects described below, sequencing is well advanced for the gallery of organisms shown in Figure 1.10, includ ing mosquitoes, honeybees, water fleas, a frog, a fruit bat, sea squirts and urchins, cows, a possum and a wallaby, and several primates. The w ide phy logenetic representation of organisms reflects the notion that analysis of pat terns of sequence conservation and evolution will be an indispensible tool in making sense of the human genome. Draft genom e sequences can be pro duced for most animals within 3 to 6months, and may soon only take days. The NHGRI has a policy of rapid public dissemination of the data so that each community can immediately begin the task of genom e annotation.
Primate Genome Projects
Rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatto) diverged from humans 25 million years ago, yet are sufficiently similar in so many aspects of their physiology, immunology, and neurobiology that they have becom e an essential m odel for infectious disease and vaccine research. The average sequence identity with human genes is 93%, compared with 99% for the chimpanzee, so the complete genom e sequence (RMGSAC 2007) provides a convenient refer ence point for defining constrained sequences, for polarizing the identity of gains and losses of genes in higher primates, and for inference of natural selection on components of the immune system and other genes. Levels of polymorphism are similar to those found among humans, but there appears to be much greater population structure, with Indian and Chinese macaque populations diverging considerably throughout the genome. One particu larly striking observation is that 229 amino acid substitutions that lead to severe human diseases (including mental retardation and cystic fibrosis) appear to be the normal wild-type allele in macaques. The draft sequence of Clint, a member of our closest relative species, the chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes), has also been used to inform our understand ing of human evolution. For example, Clint's genom e sequence revealed far more divergence due to insertion-deletion polymorphism than had previ ously been appreciated (CSAC 2005). Although less com m on than SNPs, there are approaching 5 million indels that collectively affect approximately 3% of the euchromatin of humans and chimps. Overall, purifying selection and genetic drift are inferred to dominate the landscape of primate genome

evolution, with almost 30% of all chimp protein sequences being identical to that of their human orthologs. Most other proteins differ by only a few amino acids. Those that are more divergent have probably experienced pos itive selection, including proteins that offer protection from the malaria par asite and pathogenic microbes, sperm proteins, and pain receptors. A major insight offered by the chimp sequence is that it helps geneticists to infer whether disease-associated variants in the human genom e are derived or ancestral, since the chimp allele is assumed to have been inherited from our com m on ancestor. Two research groups have announced first-pass, high-throughput sequences of Neanderthal genomic DNA from the leg bone of a 38,000 year old Croat ian fossil (Green et al. 2006; Noonan et al. 2006). Both studies conclude—not without controversy—that m odem humans had diverged from Neanderthals by 350,000years ago (considerably before humans arrived in Europe), and that little if any admixture between the primitive hominids occurred after that time. Further whole-genome sequences of multiple Neanderthals will soon add sig nificantly to our perspective on contemporary diversity. Low-quality draft sequences are available for several other primates, including the gorilla, gibbon, and orangutan. Those of two primitive pri mates, the bushbaby or galago (Otolemur garnettii) and the m ouse lemur (Microcebus murinus), are available through the Ensembl genom e browser.
Rodent Genome Projects
Almost a century of genetic research on mice and rats has ensured that these small mammals will occupy a central place in genome research. Three major advantages of rodent research are:
1. The existence of a large number of mutant strains that, combined with the potential for whole-genome mutagenesis, will lead eventually to genetic analysis of every identified locus in the genomes.
2. The existence of a panel of approximately 100 com m only used labora tory m ouse strains with well-characterized genealogy—a formidable resource for the study of genetic variation and complex quantitative traits.
3. The evolutionary position of rodents, which are sufficiently divergent at the DNA sequence level from humans that the existence of conserved sequence blocks is generally an indicator of functional constraint, yet are sufficiently close to humans that many aspects of development, physiol ogy, and the genetics of disease are shared.
The first public draft of the mouse genom e sequence was published in late 2002 (MGSC 2002), and that of the rat follow ed within 18 months (RGSPC 2004). Like the human, these genom e sequences are constantly updated on their respective NCBI, UCSC, and Ensembl browsers. Although mutant strains of mice have been a productive source of mate rial for genetic research for the better part of a century, functional genom ic analysis of this m odel organism has been stimulated by three major advances achieved in the 1990s:


GENOME PROJECTS: ORGANIZATION AND OBJECTIVES 31
• First, the technology for targeted mutagenesis by hom ologous recombi nation of the wild-type locus with a disrupted copy has becom e routine. Time and expense are the only major obstacles to reverse genetics (mov ing from gene to phenotype), a strategy that is only likely to increase in popularity as gene expression profiling and comparative mapping define candidate genes for numerous traits.
• Second, several groups around the w orld have embarked on saturation random mutagenesis program s—that is, screens conducted on such a large scale that a point is reached where m ost new mutations occur in loci already defined by an existing mutation. Dominant mutations are much easier to identify than recessive ones, but even recessive mutations can be recovered in F3designs, in which the researcher looks for onefourth of the grand progeny to show an aberrant phenotype in a sibship, as will be discussed in Chapter 5.
• Third, the expense associated with colony maintenance has led to emer gence of "phenom ic" analysis, in which mutagenized lines are subject to batteries of biochemical, physiological, immunological, morphological, and behavioral tests in parallel by large research consortia. This approach offers the best prospect for large-scale identification of those genes required for non-lethal phenotypes, supplementing traditional analysis of embryogenesis, skeletogenesis, and skin and coat defects.
Reflecting the centrality of laboratory-bred strains in m ouse genetics, most of the genom ic resources for mice are organized through a Web site at the Jackson Laboratory in Bar Harbor, Maine (http://www.informatics.jax.org). This M ouse Genome Informatics site (MGI; Figure 1.11) includes a central role for physical and genetic maps, as well as search engines that allow searches by key word, accession numbers, expression patterns, and genomic

In this approximately 1-Mb region, there is almost perfect correspondence in the order, orientation, and spacing of 23 putative genes, including four interleukins. Within the region, 245 conserved sequences of more than 100 bp with 70% identity were detected, many of which fall in noncoding regions (red arrows).

Two of the conserved blocks (red bars, with the indicat ed levels of identity) fall between genes, whereas most of the others (blue bars) are in the introns and exons of the genes. Such alignments are readily prepared online using PipMaker (http://pipmaker.bx.psu.edu/pipmaker/; Schwartz et al. 2000). (B and C after Loots et al. 2000, Figures 1 and 2.)


34 CHAPTER 1
Three unique features provided b y the MGI site are the Pathways, Strains/SNPs, and Orthology pages. Strains/SNPs provides access to the standard laboratory strains, as well as a collection of recombinant inbred lines derived from several of them, that have already been typed for a high density of molecular markers. This information facilitates both quantitative trait dissection and the mapping of new Mendelian mutations as they are generated. Pathways is a browsable database of biochemical pathways known as MouseCyc; and Orthology is a rodent-centric tool for finding related genes in other species.
Other Vertebrate Biomedical Models
Two vertebrate genom es fully sequenced in 2004 included the red jungle fowl (chicken; Gallus gallus) and the d o g {Canis familiaris). The major moti vations for sequencing both of these species were biomedical: chickens are an important model for oncogenesis and virology (which also has enormous agronomic implications), while dogs are emerging as an essential m odel for a w ide range of complex diseases such as dermatitis, parasite infection, can cer, arthritis, diabetes, and behavioral disorders. From a biological stand point, the availability of these genom es was also expected to boost research into avian evolution and poultry science, as well as studies of the impact of artificial selection on canine breed diversity (ICGSC 2004). More Mendelian disorders have been identified in dogs than in any other vertebrate, and many of these are breed-specific. Interestingly, much effort was put into identifying the m ost highly inbred d og before sequencing began so as to minimize the impact of polym orphism on assembly of the genom e sequence (the lucky canine turned out to be a boxer named Tasha). It is possible to distinguish breeds on the basis of polym orphic microsatel lite sequences (Parker et al. 2004) and the degree of sharing and differenti ation of the genetic material facilitates dissection of the obvious m orpho logical, physiological, and behavioral differences between chihuahuas and greyhounds, or between beagles and sheepdogs (Ostrander and Kruglyak 2000). For example, a single mutation in the Igfl insulin-like growth factor gene contributes to small size in most small breeds (Sutter et al. 2007). For the purposes of genetic analysis of vertebrate development, the zebrafish Danio rerio is an excellent complement to the mouse. Rapid and transparent embryogenesis, ease of culture, the existence of a dense genetic map, and a preponderance of available cell biological tools have established it as a m odel for the study of embryogenesis, neurogenesis, and organogen esis in particular. Saturation mutagenesis screens have uncovered thousands of genes that are required for the proper development of organs such as the heart and eye; of the musculature and appendages; for axon guidance; and for b od y symmetry and simple behaviors. In addition, screens for mater nal-effect loci are expected to help dissect fundamental aspects of pattern formation in the embryo. The zebrafish genom e project can be accessed through the Zebrafish Information Network (http://zfin.org) which pro vides tools for functional genom ic analysis, including extensive anatomical

and gene expression atlases, high-density polymorphism databases for finestructure recombination mapping, and online strain resources. Extensive sequence analysis of two evolutionarily divergent pufferfish with unusu ally small genomes, Tetraodon nigroviridis and Fugu rubripes, is also well advanced, while genetic maps are under development for a variety of eco logically and commercially important fish species, including tilapia and other cichlids, sticklebacks, and salmonids.
Animal Breeding Projects
Genom e projects to enhance animal and plant breeding efforts are being pursued, building on decades of classical genetic analysis. The Online Mendelian Inheritance in Animals database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ sites/entrez?db=omia) brings together linkage data and genetic maps for over a dozen species of agricultural importance. The site provides search engines that allow researchers to access data on inheritance patterns, molec ular linkage, and molecular biology. Information can be accessed by disease or trait, as well as by species. Although whole-genome sequencing of the cow is complete and that of the horse and p ig are well advanced, sequence analysis of farm animals has concentrated on the developm ent of high-density genetic maps and EST databases that aim to identify tags hom ologous to genes that have been iden tified in m odel organisms. Characterization of polymorphism within and among breeds will just as importantly support advancement of quantitative genetic analysis, a discipline that has its origins in animal and plant breed ing, and is of ever increasing econom ic importance. Although Mendelian loci that lead to disease and mortality are a great burden on agriculture, the future benefits of breeding programs lie in improvements in yield, infec tious disease resistance, adaptation to climatic conditions, and im proved food quality, not to mention m axim izing the benefits of transgenic tech nology. These goals will be met both through enhanced genetic map devel opment and through association studies using SNP technology, as discussed in Chapter 3. Each of the major farm animal genom e projects has its ow n site or sites. In the United States these are supported by the Agricultural Research Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture and by the initiatives of individual research groups, many of which are associated with veterinary schools. The Roslin Institute in Edinburgh has overseen the establishment of a series of ArkDBs (http://www.thearkdb.org;H u et al. 2001),that now provide genome resources for 12species: cat, chicken, cow, deer, duck, horse, pig, quail, salmon, sea bass, sheep, and turkey. Most of these have nodes, or alternate sites, organ ized in Europe, Japan, and Australia. Each site provides continuously updated chromosome maps, data from radiation hybrid mapping panels, and marker databases that enable researchers anywhere in the world to carry out link age studies with the m ost current marker densities. Organism-specific resources include information on com mon breeds, meeting and workshop announcements, and links that facilitate comparative genome analyses.


36 CHAPTER 1
Invertebrate Model Organisms
The first genom es of multicellular eukaryotes to be sequenced in their entirety were those of the nematode w orm Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans Sequencing Consortium 1998) and the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster (Adams et al. 2000). These remarkable technological achievements were undertaken in part as proof-of-principle for the sequencing of considerably larger vertebrate genomes and in part for the intellectual excitement of learn ing what makes a com plex organism tick, but primarily as support for tra ditional molecular genetic research. The subsequent sequencing of a dozen different Drosophila species was undertaken largely as a m odel for how to use comparative genom e data to functionally annotate genomes (Drosophila 12 Genom es Consortium 2007; Stark et al. 2007), while the sequencing of several other nematode species has more direct biomedical and agronomic importance from the perspective of parasite biology. Most of the tens of thou sands of investigators studying these organisms spend several hours each day mining genom e data through the FlyBase (http://www.flybase.org)and WormBase (http://www.wormbase.org)Web sites. A concerted effort has been made to standardize the look and function ality of plant and animal databases. This effort is led by the Generic M odel Organism Database (GMOD) project (Figure 1.13). This resource provides web tools and open source software for database construction and manage ment. The Apollo and GBrowse visualization tools provide a familiar envi ronment for examining gene structure (illustrated for Drosophila in Figure 1.14), while other m odules facilitate exploration of gene ontology and gene expression. Some of the computational issues involved in relational and object-oriented database schemas are discussed in Box 1.3. Comparison of the content of the fruit fly and nematode genom es con firmed som e long-held suspicions, but also revealed a few surprises. Unex pectedly, there are perhaps as many as 50% more genes in the nematode genom e than in the fly genom e (19,000 versus 13,500), despite the fact that the fly is much more com plex at several levels, including number of cells, number of cell types, and nervous system organization. Until recently, it was thought that C. elegans represented an ancient, evolutionarily conserved m ode of development, but phylogenetic revision suggests that the nema tode is most likely to be a highly derived molting protostome, or ecdysozoan. It is possible that an increase in gene number accompanied the evo lution of its largely invariant m ode of development. Some of the difference in gene number can be attributed to the expansion and contraction of par ticular gene families, such as the surprising surplus of steroid-hormone receptors in the nematode and the expansion of the olfactory receptor fam ily in Drosophila. In any case, it is clear that there is no simple relationship between gene number and tissue complexity—or for that matter, between gene number and DNA content. Possibly the most profound revelation is the high degree of conservation in both species of all of the major regula tory and biochemical pathways, most if not all of which also are identifiable in the unicellular eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae and in the various ver tebrate genom es (Carroll et al. 2004). However, the expansion and contrac

tion of gene families has played a crucial role in the evolution of develop ment, as discussed by Canestro et al. (2007) and others. From the point of view of functional genomics, a major impact of the invertebrate genom e projects is the prospect of obtaining identifiable muta tions for every single gene of the genomes. In flies, this is being achieved by a combination of saturation mutagenesis and construction of a library of

overlapping deficiencies that remove every segment of each chromosome. Some elegant genetic trickery has been employed to enable targeted muta genesis as well. In the nematode, saturation mutagenesis has been supple mented with RNAi technology, in which double-stranded RNA can literally be fed to the w orm s in their diet of E. coli, with the result that function of the corresponding gene is more often than not reproducibly reduced, if not eliminated. As described in Chapter 5, over 85% of the genes on the five C. elegans chrom osom es have been knocked out—a forerunner of ambitious functional genomic analyses in other m odel organisms. These resources are backed up by stock centers at the University of Minnesota (nematodes), and at Indiana University and in Kyoto (flies) that are the lifeblood of inverte brate genetic research. Molecular resources such as SNP databases, probe and genom ic clone collections, monoclonal antibody collections, and resources for microarray construction are supported by the respective genom e projects. The publication of genom e sequences has bolstered the proposition that invertebrates are not just m odels for the study of development and physi

ology, but can shed direct light on human disease (Rubin et al. 2000). More than 60% of a representative sample of 289 human genes that are mutated, amplified, or deleted in human diseases have an ortholog in the genom e of D. melanogaster. The corresponding number is only slightly lower for C. elegans and, despite the fact that the yeast S. cerevisiae is unicellular, som e 20% of human disease genes have orthologs even in that organism. Figure 1.15 shows the fraction of human disease genes in each of six categories that have orthologs in the fly, nematode, and yeast genomes, as detected by sequence similarity at three levels of significance within protein domains. Extrapolating from observations of the conservation of genetic interactions across the animal kingdom, w e can confidently expect the genetic analysis of flies and worm s to help uncover genes that interact with known diseasepromoting loci in humans. It is important to appreciate that there is no pre sumption that the invertebrate trait is the same as a mammalian trait; rather, the fact that molecular interactions between gene products can be conserved even when they affect distinct processes allows the functional comparison of genes across species (Bier 2005).


40 CHAPTER 1
BOX 1.3 Managing and Distributing Genome Data
As with many areas of science and technol
ogy, genome science has benefited greatly
from advances in computing capabilities.
Improved computational speed has been
important, but a strong argument can be
made that the growth of the internet has
been even more crucial for genome scien
tists. In conjunction with the maturation of
modem database technology, the World
Wide Web has become the natural medium
for managing and distributing genomic
dataT.he emergence of the internet allowed
the creation of centralized data warehouses.
Just as important, it led to the creation of
shared public resources for searching and
analyzing the contents of genomic data
bases. Full-featured Web sites such as those
at NCBI (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov)
and EBI (http://www.ensembl.org)provide
immediate access to enormous amounts of
data and analysis tools, free of charge, from
anywhere on the globe. This is a dramatic
change from the situation just over a decade
ago, when the GenBank database was dis
tributed by paid subscription in a small
notebook full of 5.25" floppy disks!
Networking advances have also been
important for within-laboratory data man
agement. Automated capture devices allow
data to be added to a lab's database imme
diately, and with little or no human inter
vention. Centralized laboratory informa
tion management systems, or LIMS, then
allow users at multiple workstations (or
even multiple geographic locations) to
browse, edit, analyze, and annotate the
data. These integrated systems, while they
often do not offer cutting-edge analysis
tools, provide a relatively seamless work
environment and keep the user from refor
matting data to satisfy the needs of indi
vidual analysis programs. New tools for
internet-based data management are avail
able through http://www.geocities.com/
SiliconValley/Vista/2207/sqll.html.
Although LIMS systems are invaluable
time-savers in the lab, data format remains
one of the annoyances of daily work in
genome analysis. Sequence editors, data
bases, and statistical tools often require
their own data format. Efforts to create stan
dards exist, but have largely been unsuc
cessful because of the effort needed to retro
fit existing software. Programs such as
READSEQ, designed to convert among
numerous popular formats, are essential
items in the toolkit of genome scientists.
The core item for management and dis
tribution of genomic data is a database
system. Most databases can be classified as
either relational databases (RDB) or
object-oriented databases (OODB). These
systems should be contrasted with familiar
spreadsheet and flat file databases, such as
text files and Microsoft ExcelTM, which
store data and facilitate searches but are
not designed for communication among
files. Descriptions of the basic features of
the different types of databases can be
accessed at numerous Web sites, such as
those provided by Microsoft and Oracle,
or by the Object Management Group
(http://www.omg.org).
Experts debate the relative merits of the
two database philosophies. For our pur
poses, it is well established that RDBs are
very effective for storing, searching, and
distributing data that fits nicely into tabular
format. OODBs are particularly good at

especially useful for performing analyses on
sequence "objects." Descriptions of objects
include information about the stored data,
along with functions for operating on the
data objects—a very efficient programming
approach.
In contrast to simple techniques for

achievement that was the result of a truly international consortium using a top-down approach of tiling across a physical map of clones. The Arabidopsis sequence was published in five installments, by chromosome, in Nature in 1999 and 2000. The sequenced portion of 115 Mb is approximately the same size as that of the euchromatic portion of Drosophila melanogaster, but contains almost


42 CHAPTER 1
twice as many predicted genes (25,500). This gene com plem ent seems to have evolved via two rounds of whole-genome duplication followed by extensive shuffling of chrom osom al regions and considerable gene loss. However, over 1,500 tandem arrays (generally tw o or three copies) of repeated genes have also been identified, with the result that the majority of genes are duplicated at some level and can be assigned to just 11,000 fam ilies. Some geneticists now regard this number as representative of the min imal complexity required to support complex multicellularity and believe it likely that all plant and animal genomes represent modifications of a basic "toolkit" of gene families that evolved more than a billion years ago. In addition to the high level of segmental duplication (Figure 1.16), the complete sequence of the Ambidopsis genom e illustrates several features that distinguish plant from animal genomes. Over 800 nuclear genes may be of plastid descent, indicating that transfer of organellar DNA to the nucleus is probably an ongoing process. Many of these genes have lost the protein plastid-targeting signal, however, and so can n ow function in the cytoplasm. Transposable elements, including novel miniature elements such as MITEs and MULEs, account for at least 10% of the Ambidopsis genome; as in ani mals, these elements are concentrated in repetitive centromeric heterochro matin. Centromeric DNA is enriched for at least 40 families of repeat, and the genom ic sequence opens up possibilities for functional characterization of centromeric as well as telomeric structural features. Plant genomes contain several classes of genes that are either absent from or underrepresented in animal genomes. The products of these "plant-spe cific" genes include: • Enzymes required for cell wall biosynthesis.
• Transport proteins that move organic nutrients, inorganic ions, toxic com pounds, metabolites, and even proteins and nucleic acids between cells.
• Certain enzymes and other macromolecules required for photosynthe sis, such as Rubisco and electron transport proteins.
• Products involved in plant turgor and the responses peculiar to a ses sile lifestyle, including phototrophic and gravitropic responses.
• Numerous enzymes and cytochromes involved in the production of the hundreds of thousands of secondary metabolites found in flowering plants.
• A large number of pathogen resistance R genes and associated factors. These are generally highly polymorphic, as are mammalian defenserelated genes; but unlike the genes of the mammalian immune system, R genes are dispersed throughout the genom e rather than being local ized in a single complex.
Plants share with animals many of the gene families involved in intercel lular communication, transcriptional regulation, and signal transduction during development, but there are som e notable exceptions. For example, A. thaliana lacks hom ologs of the Ras G-protein family and tyrosine kinase receptors (although there are many serine-threonine kinases), and there are

no obvious Rel, Forkhead, or nuclear steroid receptor class transcription fac tors. On the other hand, plant genom es encode variant forms of chromatin rem odeling proteins, including histone deacetylases and SNF2 ATPases; several unique families of transcription factors; and novel components that mediate plant hormone function.


44 CHAPTER 1
As with other m odel organisms, there is much more to the Arabidopsis genom e project than the complete genom e sequence. The Web site for the The Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR; http://www.arabidopsis.org) allows researchers to integrate the genom e sequence with an extensive EST database and with the genetic and physical maps. The site provides links to functional and molecular genetic data and the literature for specific genes, and it shows an ever expanding list of mutant stocks. An alternative resource for Arabidopsis and many other plants, UK CropNet (http://ukcrop.net; Dicks et al. 2000),uses com mon AceDB or WebAce platforms to coordinate genetic and molecular data (see Box 1.3 for a general discussion of genom e data base management). One resource that has been particularly useful for quantitative genetic analysis is the availability of several sets of recombinant inbred (RI) lines. Molecular maps of these lines are constantly being updated by individual users, which presents a challenge for the ongoing task of aligning physical and genetic map data and means that the quality of new data must con stantly be assessed and monitored. Gene expression data, structural infor mation, primers for genotyping microsatellites and SNPs, and information about mutant stocks are all immediately accessible.
Grasses and Legumes
Genome initiatives are under way for more than 50 different plant species. From an economic standpoint, the most important of these projects are those for the major feed crops—the grasses maize, rice, wheat, sorghum and bar ley; the forage legum es soybean and alfalfa, the forage rye grasses and fescues, and potential sources of bioethanol such as switchgrass and sugar cane. Several of these genom es are so large (as a result of autopolyploidization and the dramatic expansion of repetitive DNA) that whole-genom e sequencing is impractical, and efforts have instead focused on comparative genom e methods. Both rice (Oryza sativa) and maize (Zea mays), however, have relatively small genom es and are such key elements of the agricultural economies of the developed w orld that complete genom e sequences have been prioritized. Draft genom es of the two major rice genom e cultivars, japonica and indica, were published by Syngenta (Goff et al. 2002) and the Beijing Genomics Institute (Yu et al. 2002),respectively, and a complete Oryza sequence has since been published (IRGSP 2005). Gene identification in maize has been advanced by techniques such as methylation filtering and high C ()t selection that remove intergenic and highly repetitive sequences, effectively reducing the size of the genom e more than fivefold for sequenc ing purposes (Whitelaw et al. 2003). Comparison of genom e sequences of rice and Arabidopsis suggests that extensive but complex patterns of synteny will be a useful feature of plant genom ics (Figure 1.17). Medicago (alfalfa) is a true diploid legume that, along with its crucial role in fixing soil nitrogen, constitutes a major part of forage diets. Thus Med icago has been selected as the m odel legume for whole-genome sequencing. The remaining grasses and legum es are the subjects of extensive EST

sequencing and high-resolution genetic map construction in hopes of tak ing advantage of the expected pervasive synteny within these families. Web sites established by individual research groups integrate research efforts from around the globe. Some useful Web sites include the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Gramene resource (http://www.gramene.org), w hich is designed to facilitate comparative genom e mapping; and organism-specific resources such as MaizeGDB (http://www.m aizegdb.org).A com mon objec tive of these sites is to link seed stock and real genetic resources to virtual data on linkage and mapping, QTL localization, EST and genome sequences, and biochemical pathway information, among other resources. The maize, rice, and alfalfa initiatives all focus strongly on quantitative genetic resources, in contrast with the Mendelian focus of many m odel ani mal genom e projects. Economically important traits include resistance to a broad range of pathogens; flowering time, seed set, grain morphology, and related yield traits; tolerance to drought, salt, heavy metals, and other extreme environmental circumstances; and measures of feed quality such as protein and sugar content. Each of these characters can be im proved through combinations of genetic engineering and specialized plant breed ing techniques, including introgression of germ line from wild ecotypes. More traditional focus on the genetic basis of heterosis, hybrid vigor, unusual phenotypic segregation, as well as efforts to limit inbreeding depression, will also benefit from improved maps and a more general appreciation of the extent and distribution of polym orphism in the genome. Given the role of artificial selection in the recent derivation of grasses in particular, these genom e projects prom ise to reveal much information regarding the evolution of domesticated species. Several genes have been identified in maize that were clearly selected during the transition from wild teosinte to cultivated maize, leading to modification of traits such as glume architecture, ear size, and a change from multiple branches to a single stalk

(tiller). Although folklore suggests that cultivated crops are highly inbred, molecular population genetic data contradicts this notion. In fact, dom es ticated maize is highly polymorphic relative to most animal species. As in other crop grasses, diversity in domesticated maize is reduced by a maxi mum of a mere 30% relative to its presumed wild progenitors (Buckler et al. 2001). However, strongly selected portions of loci, such as the upstream reg ulatory region of teosinte branched 1, show a marked reduction in diversity that is indicative of a selective sweep that brought one haplotype associated with the selected site close to fixation, purging linked polym orphism in the process (Figure 1.18). The selected site is thought to upregulate expression of the tbl gene, which encodes a repressor of lateral branch elongation, resulting in the evolution of single-tillered plants (Wang et al. 1999). Crop plants are thus established as excellent m odel systems for studying the molecular basis of morphological divergence, as well as other types of p o p ulation genetic analysis.
Other Flowering Plants
Over 90 different angiosperm genom e projects are active around the world. These include African projects on beans, com, and fungal pathogens; Aus tralian projects on cotton, wheat, pine, and sugarcane; at least two dozen European projects that include vegetables such as cabbage, cucumber, and pea, and fmits such as apple, peach and plum; and over 50 North Ameri can projects as diverse as turf grass, chrysanthemum, almond, papaya, and

poplar. The com m on denominator among all of these projects is the assem bly of genetic maps (and in som e cases physical maps) and the placement of a com m on set of plant genes on them. For som e species, large EST sequencing projects are also in place, with the twin objectives of enabling comparative genomic analysis (particularly in regions of synteny) and QTL mapping. Several m odel organisms in addition to Arabidopsis and the grasses are receiving particular attention as a result of a long history of genetic analy sis and/or the potential light these organisms may shed on plant evolution. These include the snapdragon (Antirrhinum majus), in which numerous clas sical flowering mutants were initially isolated as a result of transposable ele ment movement; sunflowers (Helianthus spp.) and monkey flowers (Mimulus spp.), which are of particular interest in studies of hybrid speciation and adaptation in the wild; and the variants of Brassica oleracea (cabbage, kale, Brussels sprouts, broccoli, cauliflower, and kohlrabi), which are in the same family (Brassicaceae) as Arabidopsis and are a fascinating m odel for dom es tication because they all derive from the spontaneous mutation of genes involved in meristem growth (Purugganan et al. 2000). Forest trees are an example of an area where genom ic analysis has the potential for economic impact where classical genetics has been problem atic (Figure 1.19). The first fully sequenced forest tree genom e is that of the black cottonw ood (Populus trichocarpa; Tuskan et al. 2007). High-density genetic maps of spruce, loblolly and several other pines, as well as a few species of Eucalyptus, have been established using a combination of AFLP


48 CHAPTER 1
and microsatellite markers and applied to the m apping of Mendelian and quantitative trait loci affecting w ood quality, growth, and flowering param eters. These maps can be accessed through the Dendrom e Web site (http://dendrome.ucdavis.edu). Marker-assisted selection has the promise to improve desired traits dramatically, at least to the extent that phenotypes measurable in seedlings predict mature qualities. Comparative analyses and transcription profiling of genes involved in w o o d properties including lignins and enzymes that regulate cell wall biosynthesis (many of which can be identified by large EST sequencing efforts) will also have an impact on forest biotechnology throughout the world. Several staple crop plants are obviously poised to benefit from genomics, including potato and other tubers, tomato, tobacco, beans, and cotton. Ana lyzing the genom e diversity of ecotypes endemic to the original source of these crops—many of which com e from tropical regions—has the poten tial to affect productivity in developing countries as well as to support yield and quality improvements in countries where monocultures are employed. The political, legal, and sociological implications of proprietary rights to a plant's germ plasm and the polym orphic DNA sequences identified within it are being addressed as much in courts of law as by international agencies. N o plant equivalent of the Human Genome Project's ELSI initia tive has yet been established.
Microbial Genome Projects
The Minimal Genome
The first complete cellular genom es to be sequenced were of prokaryotes, starting with Haemophilus influenzae (Fleischmann et al. 1995) and quickly followed by Mycoplasma genitalium (Fraser et al. 1995), three other bacteria, and, in September of 1997, that of Escherichia coli (Blattner et al. 1997). The primary sequences provided immediate information about genom e struc ture (organization of replication, GC content, transposable elements, recom bination) and genom e content (total number of genes, representation of con served gene families). Gene annotation is initially more straightforward for prokaryotes than for eukaryotes, since open reading frames tend to be uninterrupted and genes tend to be closely spaced; however, the assignment of adjacent genes to operons is not trivial. Typically, more than three-quarters of the ORFs in a microbial genom e can be assigned a function based on their similarity to genes in other organisms and/or by identifying protein domains. The remaining genes may encode yet-to-be-described functions, they may rep resent taxon-specific functions, or they may be evolving so rapidly that their function is conserved despite sequence divergence. Bioinformatic approaches are being em ployed to com plete the functional annotation of microbial genomes. Similarities in gene content between the three bacterial genomes mentioned above, as well as the first sequenced genome of an Archaea (Methanococcus jan

The average gene length in each species is thus close to 1.1 kb, indicating that differences in genome size are based on changes in gene number, which in turn reflect duplication and divergence in larger genomes, as well as gene loss in small genomes. It is usually possible to identify specialized metabolic functions that reflect a microbe's adaptation to a particular ecological niche (such as mammalian genital, respiratory, or enteric tracts) b y surveying the predicted enzym e and transporter complement. Indeed, one aim of microbial genom ics is to be able to predict metabolic phenotypes on the basis of gene content alone, as discussed in Chapter 6. Comparative analysis of sequences in pathogenic strains of E. coli and in various pathogenic species in the Bacillus (includ ing anthrax) and Mycoplasma genera hint at the genetic basis of virulence and pathogenicity and may suggest novel approaches to antibiotic design. The concept of the minimal genom e refers to attempts to define the min imum complement of genes that are necessary and sufficient to maintain a

free-living organism—in a sense, to define genetically "What is life"? Two general strategies have been pursued to achieve such a definition. A survey of multiple complete bacterial genom e sequences to identify a com m on "core" genom e suggests that at least 206 genes are always present in micro bial genomes, and hence essential (Gil et al. 2004). By contrast, random insertional mutagenesis of genes in M. genitalium suggests that just 100 of its genes can be disrupted without affecting the bacterium's capacity to grow in rich medium, implying that at least 370 genes are required for growth in this species (Glass et al. 2006). Similarly, comprehensive mutagenesis of the 4,100 genes of the B. subtilis genom e revealed that just 271 of them are indispensible under favorable growth conditions, and most of these are involved in a relatively small number of functions relating to metabolism, cell divi

GENOME PROJECTS: ORGANIZATION AND OBJECTIVES 51
sion and shape, and synthesis of the cellular envelope (Kobayashi et al. 2003). We can thus infer that life can be supported by a genom e of between 250 and 400 genes performing those functions shown for the schematic cell in Figure 1.20. However, it is hard to imagine such a minimal organism p os sessing any competitive advantage outside of a petri dish. Efforts are also under w ay to build a viable organism from scratch by stitching together artificially synthesized genes, building on the assembly of a poliovirus from published sequence data (Cello et al. 2002). In addition to this re-synthesis of a poliovirus, a com plete M. genitalium genom e has been built stepwise by combining overlapping 7 kb cassettes into succes sively larger fragments, first in vitro and then in E. coli and yeast vectors (Gibson et al. 2008). Mycoplasmas are ideal for this strategy since they use the UGA codon to encode tryptophan, whereas UGA is read as a standard stop codon in other microbes; this crucial difference reduces the potential toxicity of the gene fragments. Since it has also proved possible to transplant the genom e of M. mycoides into M. capricolum (Lartigue et al. 2007), it is only a matter of time before synthetic genom es containing completely artificial mixtures of genes are assembled and devised for a w ide range of purposes. One of the first insights provided by microbial genom e analysis was the realization that bacterial genom es are much more modular and evolutionarily labile than hitherto appreciated. An intriguing feature of the E. coli genom e is the evidence for genom e plasticity in the form of repetitive sequences and insertions of several families of IS class transposable ele ments, as well as the presence of cryptic prophages and prophage remnants. Another element of bacterial plasticity, uncovered by com bining com par isons of phylogenetic distributions with studies of the distribution of GC content and cod on biases, is horizontal gene transfer, or gene exchange across species (Woese 2000). Adaptation and divergence in microbes is now seen to be associated with a dynamic process of loss and gain of genes, notwithstanding the conservation of a com m on core of othologs that can be revealed by careful phylogenetic analysis of quartets of completed genome sequences (Daubin et al. 2003).
Sequenced Microbial Genomes
The Comprehensive Microbial Resource (CMR) of the J. Craig Venter Insti tute (http://cmr.jcvi.org/tigr-scripts/CMR/CmrHomePage.cgi) provides online access to complete sequences and associated resources for over 400 microbial genom e sequences. The CMR provides tools for searching, sum marizing, or analyzing each genome, as well as comparative tools that facil itate alignment, annotation, and pathway analyses. Standardized compact or circular chromosomal displays (Figure 1.21) show each gene color-coded according to its orientation and the predicted molecular function of its prod uct, and include mouse-over links to background information, publications, and data on each individual sequence annotation.

The Microbial Genomes page of the Entrez Genom e Project site (Figure 1.22) lists over 1,600 microbial sequences at various stages of completion; almost half of these are already complete. Over 80 of the genomes sequenced are from the kingdom Archaea. The species genom es are listed according to their size, GC content, phenotype, growth requirements, and any patho genic characteristics. Each genom e can be displayed simply by clicking on the taxon name. For complete genomes, a series of tools are available, includ ing taxonomic maps of closely related genes in other species (T), a table list ing all predicted proteins (P), clusters of orthologs (COGs C), proteins pre dicted to have similar structures (D), a BLAST tool for the microbe (L), a list of conserved domains in the proteins (S), a pairwise whole-genome sequence alignment plot (G), a taxonomic plot of related genes in any two other species (X), and FTP site for sequence and annotation download (F), and a link to publications (R).

54 CHAPTER 1
Funding for microbial genom e research is largely driven by medical research and econom ic motives, but there is a strong evolutionary com po nent to the sampling strategy. Broad sampling increases the pow er of phy logenetic analysis, which is a valuable tool for the functional classification of members of gene families. Sam pling from a w ide variety of habitats, including extreme environments such as thermal vents, is also likely to lead to the identification of novel genes, or gene products adapted for functions that can be utilized by biotechnologists (such as the Taq thermally stable DNA polymerase). Table 1.5 provides a survey of the range of sequenced microbial genomes.
Yeast
The com plete genom e sequence of the buddin g yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was published in a supplement to the journal Nature in May of 1997 (Mewes et al. 1997). The 12 Mb sequence was assem bled from roughly 300,000 sequence reads generated in over 100 laboratories and had an ini tial estimated error rate of 3 in 10,000bases. Approximately 6,000predicted genes are spread over 16 chromosomes, which include 53 identified regions of clustered gene duplications. Slightly less than half of these genes were functionally annotated (experimentally characterized and/or identified by hom ology to sequences in other species) prior to completion of the genome sequence. Chrom osome displays and individual gene listings can be accessed through two main sites: the Saccharomyces page of the Munich Information Center for Protein Sequences (MIPS; http://mips.gsf.de/genre/proj/ yeast/index.jsp), and the Saccharomyces Genom e Database (SGD) at Stan ford University (http://www.yeastgenome.org). An enorm ous amount of information is available on the SGD locus pages for all Saccharomyces genes, including mutational, structural, biochemical, and transcription data. The SGD site provides links to basic information, as well as "additional infor mation" links that provide extensive detail, including historical notes on the annotation of the gene (the "Locus History" link, which also alerts readers to contradictions in the literature, changes in nomenclature, and other sources of potential confusion); several types of functional data ("Function Junction") and expression data ("Expression Connection"); mapping data; and advanced protein and sequence resources. Sequences of two other well studied yeasts— the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Candida albicans, a yeast com m only associated with opportunistic human infections—are now complete as well. Genomic analy sis of numerous other fungi of agricultural and biotechnological interest is underway, including those of the allergenic Aspergillus species, various fruit white rots, and the rice blast Magnaporthe grisea. More than 60 fungal genome sequences are com piled at the http://fungalgenomes.org Web site.

EXERCISE 1.5 Exam ining a g e n e in the Saccharom yces Genome Database
Answer the following questions about the yeast GAL4 gene (ora gene of your choice):
a. Write down two aliases (alternate names) for GAL4 b. List the three genes on either side o f GAL4 in the S. cerevisiae genome c. What are the three GO annotations for the gene? d. How many amino acids are there in the GAL4 protein? e. What is the phenotype o f a GAL4 mutant?
ANSWER: Each o f these questions can be answered directly from the GAL4 page found by a quick search from the SGD home page, (a) One alias is GAL8Y while the systematic name is listed as YPL248C. (b) Clicking on the small gene image at the top right brings up a local chromosomal view, from which you can see that the three genes to the left are ICY2, RPL36B, and GYP5, while those to the right are YPL247C, RBD2, and YPL245W (the "W" and “C" represent Watson and Crick strands for unannotated genes). (c) The three GO annotations (see Box 2.5) are listed as transcriptional acti vator (Molecular Function), galactose metabolism and DNA-dependent regulation o f transcription (Biological Process), and nucleus (Cellular Component), (d) You can download the protein sequence o f 881 amino acids by linking out to the Entrez Protein page (and examine the protein structure through the PDB site), (e) Null mutants cannot use galactose as a carbon source.
Several complementary approaches to functional characterization of the complete set of yeast genes have been taken. Systematic mutagenesis uses hom ologous recombination to knock out open reading frames in heterozy gous diploid cells, thus allowing complete loss of function to be monitored in haploid cells after induction of sporulation. Winzeler et al. (1999) deleted almost one-third of the yeast ORFs and found that 17% of these were essen tial for viability in rich medium, w hile 40% show ed quantitative growth defects in rich or minimal medium. Subsequently, over 96% of the yeast genome has been tagged with molecular barcodes associated with gene dele tions. A second, complementary approach is a genetic fingerprinting strat egy, in which natural selection is allowed to sort through a large population of massively mutagenized cells growing in a chemostat under a variety of conditions. These experiments similarly found that about half (157 o f 268) of the genes tagged b y a transposable element insertion resulted in a detectable reduction in fitness, with many of the genes that show ed weak effects not having been characterized previously (Smith et al. 1996). In order to characterize pairwise genetic interactions in a systematic manner, Tong et al. (2004) crossed a set of 132 query mutants to a panel of 4,700 viable yeast


GENOME PROJECTS: ORGANIZATION AND OBJECTIVES 57
deletion mutants. This approach detected over 4,000 functional interactions involving more than 1,000 genes. A fourth major experimental approach to functional annotation of the yeast genom e has been microarray analysis, which is discussed in detail in Chapter 4. Using microarrays, changes in the transcriptome have been characterized throughout the cell cycle; during meiosis; in response to envi ronmental shifts, including anoxia and nutrient source; and in a variety of mutant backgrounds. The so-called "com pendium " strategy tracks coordi nated changes in transcription under a variety of experimental circum stances, assigning genes to functional groups on the basis of co-regulation. Transcriptional data is also being supplemented with protein expression data and proteomic data, as discussed in Chapter 5.
Parasite Genomics
The World Health Organization (WHO) has singled out 10 tropical diseases that affect billions of people w orldw ide for intensive research, in the hope of eventually eradicating the pathogenic agents responsible (Table 1.6). Mos quito-transmitted viral infection is responsible for one of the target diseases. Dengue hemorrhagic fever. Seven diseases are carried by water- or insectborne eukaryotic parasites: malaria, leishmaniasis, American and African trypanosomiasis (Chagas' disease and sleeping sickness, respectively), lym phatic filariasis (elephantiasis), river blindness (onchocerciasis), and schis

tosomiasis (bilharzia). The final two infections, tuberculosis and leprosy, are caused by airborne bacteria and are transmitted from human to human. The Microbial Sequencing Centers of the J. Craig Venter Institute 0CVI) and Broad Institute provide access to 30 disease-related microbial genome projects including viruses, pathogenic protozoa, and several insect vectors. A related site, the Pathogenic Functional Genomics Resource Center, is ded icated to the provision of experimental tools for research into these organ isms. Six of the most pathogenic microbes identified by the National Insti tute of Asthma and Infectious Disease are brought together at a single site, the Pathema Microbial Resource Center, which is sponsored by the JCVI (http://pathema.jcvi.org). These include the agents responsible for anthrax, botulism, melioidosis, glanders, gas gangrene, and amebiasis, some of which are regarded as potential bioterrorism agents. Numerous parasites carried by invertebrate and animal hosts cause widespread diseases in North America and Europe, including Cryptosporid ium-induced diarrhea, zoonotic toxoplasmosis, and Lyme disease. Several infectious diseases affecting im munocompromised patients are also emerg ing. Nematode genomics in particular has direct potential for practical ben efits, building on the extensive functional analysis of the C. elegans m odel system. Crop damage caused by parasitic plant nematodes costs billions of dollars each year and causes untold human suffering around the world. In addition, globally as many as 1billion people may be infected by intestinal and other nem atodes that cause diseases including elephantiasis and num erous intestinal disorders such as ascariasis and tricuriasis. These parasites also infect farm animals and pets in the form of hookw orm and heartworm. Current approaches to disease control focus on public health issues such as improving basic living conditions and educating the public about disease transmission, but have traditionally included chemical interventions (e.g., application of pesticides, administration of antibiotics) that may have dele terious environmental consequences and often lead to increased resistance among the pathogens they are intended to destroy. The com plex lifestyle of many of these parasites also limits the effectiveness of chemical interven tion, and insect hosts have proven extremely difficult to control. Hence genomic approaches are being supported by WHO, several pharmaceutical giants, and the major genom e sequencing centers. The aims of parasite genomics include:
• Identification of species-specific genes that may be used to generate anti gens for vaccination.
• Better understanding of the developmental genetics associated with key transitions in the life cycle, suggesting targets for drug design.
• Polymorphism surveys that address the population biology of the para sites, informing epidemiological studies.
• In the case of malaria in particular, considerable effort has been devoted to the genom ics of the mosquito vector (Anopheles spp.), including map ping of loci that affect parasite (Plasmodium) transmission.


GENOME PROJECTS: ORGANIZATION AND OBJECTIVES 59
Web resources providing access to genom ic data for these and other proj ects can be accessed through TIGR, NCBI, and the European Bioinformat ics Institute parasite genom ics server (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/parasites/ parasite-genome.html).
Metagenomics
An emerging area of microbial genom ics has been dubbed metagenomics or environmental sequencing. Both terms are used to refer to the sequenc ing of literally thousands of genomes' worth of DNA extracted from an envi ronment such as ocean water, soil, or intestinal flora. The main reason for taking such an approach is that the vast majority of bacteria cannot be cul tured in vitro, which implies that our knowledge of microflora is both lim ited and biased by sampling of a relatively small fraction of the biota. The idea behind metagenomics is to circumvent this problem by directly cloning DNA fragments isolated from an appropriate size fraction of biological mate rial that largely excludes viruses and multicellular organisms, without any attempt to grow the microbes outside of their environment. The difficulty with this approach is that there is so much microbial diversity that it will take hundreds of human genome equivalents to assemble more than a hand ful of complete genomes, and most fragments are just gene pieces that can not easily be assigned to separate species. Nevertheless, the approach has greatly increased the number of known protein families (Yooseph et al. 2007) and new tools are being developed that allow assem blages of related genom es to be clustered together, facilitating studies of the distribution of microbial and viral genetic diversity across the globe (Rusch et al. 2007). Much insight into both microbial and genic diversity has been gained from the identification of novel genes in seawater. Such knowledge has the potential to change oceanographers' understanding of the mechanisms of photosynthesis and of global carbon and nitrogen cycling, as suggested by the discovery of a previously unsuspected type of rhodopsin generated in uncultured proteobacteria from a sample taken from Monterey Bay (Beja et al. 2000). Such proteorhodopsin genes have since been detected in hundreds more samples, suggesting that light harvesting need not be coupled to chlorophyll in cyanobacteria, as hitherto had been thought. By using degen erate gene-specific primers to survey samples from deep sea hydrother mal vents, Campbell et al. (2003) were able to detect a key enzyme involved in carbon fixation in bacteria associated with a polychaete worm, provid ing insight into how life is sustained in such an extreme environment. Ven ter et al. (2004) industrialized environmental sequencing by generating more than a Gigabase of sequence derived from about 1,500 liters of seawater from the nutrient-poor Sargasso Sea. In the process, they identified over one mil lion new genes (approximately equivalent to the number of genes in exist ing databases) and almost 150 new types of bacteria in an estimated sam ple of 1,800 total species! The still-untapped oceanic microbial diversity is more than an order of magnitude greater than this, and protist diversity is similarly unexplored.


60 CHAPTER 1
Similar strategies are being employed to understand phenomena such as the bacterial contribution to digestion in termites and beetles in the soil, the function of probiotic bacteria in the human gut, and microbial community structure in the rhizosphere, expanding the reach of genomics from organismal biology to functional ecology. Metagenomics data is brought together at the CAMERA (Community Cyberinfrastructure for Advanced Marine Micro bial Ecology Research and Analysis) Web site at http://camera.calit2.net.
Summary
1. Genom e science is a new w ay of looking at b iology that unites genet ics, molecular biology, computational biology, and bioinformatics.
2. The core aspects of genom e science include the utilization of organismal databases; assembly of physical and genetic maps; genom e sequencing; gene annotation; characterization of sequence diversity; expression profiling; proteomics; functional genomics; and compara tive genomics.
3. Genetic and physical maps are the foundation upon which most genom e projects are built. The two types of m aps can be unified because of the direct relationship between recombination rate and chromosomal distance, as well as by way of cytogenetic maps.
4. "Synteny" refers to the conservation of gene order am ong groups of several to tens or even hundreds of genes in divergent species. Synteny is the basis for comparative gene mapping.
5. The Human Genom e Project (HGP) has assembled a complete sequence of the human genome, and is now working to promote use of the sequence information in the domains of general biology, public health, and social policy. Additional research has proceeded apace along lines fostered by a rapidly expanding commercial sector.
6. Mouse, rat, dog, and chimpanzee genom e sequences have been com pleted, and offer the most immediately accessible vertebrate m odel organisms for genetic analysis of physiology, development, cell biol ogy, and behavior.
7. A w ide range of animal genom e projects include cow, horse, pig, sheep, dog, numerous fish species, and the two major invertebrate models. Drosophila, and Caenorhabditis.
8. The first com plete plant genom e sequence was that of the mustard w eed Arabidopsis, and significant progress has been made toward com pletion of the rice and maize genomes. Additional plant genom es being studied include legumes, grasses, fruits, vegetables, forest trees, and ornamentals.


GENOME PROJECTS: ORGANIZATION AND OBJECTIVES 61
9. Over 400 bacterial genom e sequences are available, providing a vast resource for m odeling of biochemistry, metabolism, and microbial ecology, as well as opening up new avenues of biotechnological research.
10. In addition to the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, several other fungi of industrial, biomedical, and agricultural importance have genom e projects.
11. Genom e science promises new strategies for dealing with several of the world's most devastating parasitic diseases using avenues of genetic research that were hitherto unimaginable with classical methods.
12. Metagenomics is an emerging approach that sequences DNA extract ed from an environmental m edium such as soil, ocean water, or intestinal flora. Although its methods do not typically result in com plete gene sequences, metagenomics has increased the number of known protein families and has led to the discovery of novel genes and increased insight into genic and bacterial diversity, as w ell as adding to our know ledge of the mechanisms of certain biogeochemical cycles.

1. N ow that the human genom e sequence is nearly complete, how should the excess sequencing capacity at major genom e centers be used? Is it go od use of public funds to keep sequencing more and more genom es? If so, which genom es should be prioritized?
2. The volum e and expense of genom e data raises new issues in rela tion to peer review of research and publication of results. H ow can editors and reviewers oversee data quality? Should journals demand that companies make com plete genom e sequences freely available?
3. H ow can the commercial, medical, and agricultural benefits of genom e science be extended to developing countries? Are there intel lectual property issues raised by genomic analysis of species and populations in one country, and should ownership of the data be retained by that country or transferred to the com pany that pays for the research?
4. Propose a genom e project for an animal or plant species of particular interest to you. What will be your key aims, both in terms of genera tion of genomic resources and posing of scientific questions?
5. Contrast the impact of genom ics on the fabric of basic and applied biological research with the impact that molecular biology had in the 1970s. What will be the next revolution?

Genome Sequencing
and Annotation
T
he first objective of most genom e projects is to determine the DNA sequence either of the genome or of a large number of transcripts. This endeavor leads both to the identification of all or most genes and to the characterization of various structural features of the genome. This chap ter explains the basic principles of how blocks of DN A sequence are obtained, and how these blocks are serially assembled first into contigu ous stretches of sequence (contigs) and ultimately into a whole-genom e sequence. Emerging sequencing methods that are paving the w ay toward "genomes-in-a-day for $1,000" are also described. Subsequently, the essence of the bioinformatic strategies for sequence alignment (since alignment is the basis of sequence assembly), com parison of cDNA/EST and genom ic sequences, and annotation of open reading frames is described. In addition to identifying individual genes, DNA sequences reveal information about other features of the genome, including repetitive elements; centromeres and telomeres; variable distribution of GC content; and evolutionarily con served elements of yet-to-be-determined function. This chapter concludes with a discussion of how genes are annotated by com parison with, and evolutionary analysis of, similar predicted protein sequences from other organisms.
Automated DNA Sequencing
The Principle of Sanger Sequencing
Almost all of the genome-scale sequencing performed, up to and including the Human Genom e Project, has made use of the basic chain termination method developed in 1974 by Frederick Sanger. The idea behind Sanger's


66 CHAPTER 2
method is to generate all possible single-stranded DNA molecules differing in length by one nucleotide that are complementary to a template. The tem plate starts at a com m on 5' base and extends anywhere up to 1 kilobase or more in the 3' direction. These single strands of DNA are labeled in such a way as to allow us to infer the identity of the 3'-most base in each molecule. Separation of the molecules according to size by electrophoresis results in a ladder of bands, with each adjacent band corresponding to a class of m ol ecule differing by the addition of one particular base. The sequence is then "read" from this ladder, as shown in Figure 2.1. The sequencing reaction is primed by annealing an oligonucleotide of 20 or so bases to a denatured template. The template is usually a plasmid that contains a cloned piece of DNA. The same "universal" primer can be used in all reactions, since it is complementary to a short sequence in the plasmid adjacent to the inserted DNA fragment that is being sequenced. For some applications, genom ic DNA is sequenced directly, in which case the primer is specific to a sequence within the gene. A form of the enzyme DNA poly merase is then used to catalyze synthesis of the complementary strand in the presence of all four dNTPs. The trick used to generate m olecules that differ in length by one nucleotide is to randomly terminate polymerization of the grow ing single strand sequence by the incorporation of a dideoxynucleotide (ddNTP). Whenever a ddNTP incorporates, the absence of a hydroxyl group on the sugar-phosphate backbone means that there is nothing for the next dNTP to attach to, and polymerization is effectively terminated. Once the sequenc ing reaction terminates, the DNA is again denatured and the fragments are separated by virtue of the differential retardation of the migration of mole cules of different length and electric charge through a sem iporous matrix such as that produced by an acrylamide polymer. Throughout the 1980s, most sequencing was done manually. The process was labor-intensive: each reaction was set up individually, polyacrylamide gels for electrophoretic separation were prepared by hand, and the sequence bands were read by the human eye. A radioactive label, typically 33P or 35S, was incorporated into the sequencing product as part of one of the dNTPs, and four separate reactions had to be set up for each sequence—one for each dideoxy terminator. The four reactions were run side by side on a large slab gel, and were stopped after an appropriate time so that all products within the desired size range could be visualized by exposing the gel to X-ray film. With a separation of 0.5 mm between bands corresponding to each m ole cule differing in length by one nucleotide, generally only up to 500 bases could be read from a single set of four lanes on a 30-cm gel. At least three runs of different durations had to be performed to sequence any fragment longer than 1,000base pairs. Manual sequencing was also limited by prob lems associated with poor resolution of short stretches of sequence, notably GC-rich regions that tend to compress, leading to ambiguities that could not always be resolved by sequencing the opposite strand.

High-Throughput Sequencing
In the 1990s, several advances were made that enabled the automation of Sanger sequencing. Genome-scale sequencing w ould be impossible with out these new techniques and equipment:
• Four-color fluorescent dyes replaced the radioactive label. Attachment of these dyes to the ddNTPs results in a fluorescent tag directly marking just the terminated DNA molecule. Consequently, a single sequencing reaction spiked with all four ddNTPs is sufficient to sequence any tem plate. (For som e applications, the dyes are attached to the primer, in which case four reactions are still performed but may be pooled in a sin gle lane before electrophoresis.)
• Rather than stopping electrophoresis at a particular time, the products are scanned for laser-induced fluorescence just before they run off the end of the electrophoresis medium. The sequence is collected as a set of four "trace files" that indicate the intensity of the four colors; a peak in the trace distribution im plies that the particular base was the last one incorporated at the position. Such traces can be read automatically, as described in the next section, resulting in enormous savings in time and reducing the scoring errors that inevitably creep into manual readings.
• Improvements in the chemistry of template purification and the sequenc ing reaction, including use of bioengineered thermostable polymerases that can read through secondary structure with high fidelity, has extended the length of high quality sequence. Reads greater than 1,200bp are possible with current technology, though the 500-900 bp range is more common.
• Slab gel electrophoresis gave way to capillary electrophoresis with the introduction in 1999 of Applied Biosystem's ABI Prism 3700 automated sequencers, which in 2003 were updated with ABI Prism 3730 DNA ana lyzers. These sequencers give extremely high quality, long reads; save time and m oney by abolishing the laborious and often frustrating step of gel pouring; and add a new level of automation in that the capillaries are loaded by robot from 96-well plates rather than by hand. Each machine can handle twenty 96-well plates per day, or approximately 2 Mb of sequence—which is two orders of magnitude greater than the output of a single investigator just a decade earlier. Other automated DNA sequenc ing systems are also available, including GE Healthcare's MegaBACE 4000 and Li-Cor's 4300 DNA Analysis systems.
Reading Sequence Traces
The reading of raw sequence traces, or base calling, is now routinely per formed using automated software that reads bases, aligns similar sequences, and provides an intuitive platform for editing. Genome-scale sequencing requires only minimal human input—which is a good thing, because if it took just a quarter of an hour for a single person to properly edit any given read, it w ould take seven people a very boring week to process the output from one day's operation of a single ABI Prism 3700. Automated software


GENOME SEQUENCING AND ANNOTATION 69
such as the freely available phred program developed at the University of Washington (http://www.phrap.org/phredphrapconsed.html; Ewing et al. 1998; Ewing and Green 1998),or commercial equivalents, convert traces into sequences that can be deposited in a database within seconds after the com pletion of a sequencing rim. These programs assign probability scores to the accuracy of each base call as the trace is read, and this information is uti lized in subsequent alignment steps. Whereas human observers integrate multiple pieces of information in calling a base from a sequence trace, software uses an algorithm in which the process is broken dow n into a series of steps, as outlined in Figure 2.2. First, the four traces corresponding to the four fluorescence spectra are m erged into a single file, maintaining the register of the peaks. Next the com puter calculates where it expects to find a peak, using an averaging process based on the mean distance between peaks over some stretch of the sequence. This ensures that an N is called in place of an A, C, G, or T where no base is seen, and that only a single base is called where two appear to be present. The most efficient algorithms can adjust for the increase in spac ing between peaks that occurs as the run proceeds, as well as for variation due to changes in local GC content. Subsequently, the algorithm detects local maxima for each of the four channels and checks to see that each peak occurs with the predicted spac ing relative to the adjacent peaks. Since not all peaks are the same height, and rims of the same base can show reduced peak resolution, algorithms typically employ a threshold that computes the relative magnitude of a local minimum and maximum to decide whether a peak is real. Similarly, on occa

sion the tail of one peak can be higher than the maximum of the next peak of a different nucleotide, so the program must be able to call the correct peak rather than simply detecting the highest signal. Where two peaks are called but there is only space for one, or vice-versa, peaks can be either omitted or split based on probability measures. Uncalled peaks are inserted if there is a local maximum of one dye that was not initially called as a peak. Auto mated base calling usually takes less than a half a second per 1-kb trace and results in a string of letters corresponding to the 5'-to-3' order of nucleotides. G ood software should also be able to identify instances where two dif ferent bases are present at the same site. This can occur if an individual is heterozygous, or if two or more samples have been pooled together. Align ment with other sequences greatly assists in the identification of such sin gle nucleotide polym orphism s (SNPs), but in the first stage of trace read ing, these may simply be designated as unassigned or ambiguous bases and labeled N. Probability scores can also be used to flag sites as potential SNPs. Several com m on problem s can lead to errors in sequencing, som e of which are shown in Figure 2.3. For example, the first 50 or so bases of a read are typically "noisy" due to the anomalous migration of short DNA frag ments that contain bulky dyes (Figure 2.3A). Similarly, traces becom e pro gressively less uniform as a run proceeds and the effects of diffusion are amplified while the relative mass differences between successive fragments

decreases (Figure 2.3B). In Figure 2.3C, alignment of the sequence traces of two different alleles reveals SNPs and insertion-deletion (indel) polym or phisms. Dye-terminator chemistry deals quite well with compression prob lems, but anomalies such as reduced signals of G follow ing A must be accounted for. Not all reactions w ork as well as they should, resulting in low signal-to-noise ratios and effects such as a large peak of one dye that overwhelms the true signal; these must also be recognized either by the soft ware or manual editors.
EXERCISE 2.1 R eadin g a seq u e n ce trace

ANSWER: The sequence reads:
GCTCATTTGAATAACCTGAAATGCANCAA(C /T )AACACACATTCATTTATC
Note that the base labeled N (arrow) is impossible to call due to poor sequence quality. Four nucleotides further downstream, two peaks o f the same height are observed at the same location, suggesting that the individ ual is heterozygous at this site for a C/Tsingle nucleotide polymorphism (SNP).
All automated base-calling algorithms make errors, and som e deal with particular types of ambiguity better than others. For this reason, it has becom e standard to assign error probability estimates to each base based on measures of the consistency of peak heights. The error probability, P, is then converted to a phred score, q, which is 10 times the negative logarithm of P. Thus, a phred score of less than 13 means that there is a greater than 0.05 probability that the base is incorrectly called, while a score of 30 or more means that the associated error probability is 0.001. In general, scores above 20 are regarded with high confidence.
Contig Assembly
The "finishing" stage in sequencing a stretch of DNA longer than a single clone entails alignment, editing, and error correction. All of these steps are customarily done with sequence editing software, an example of which is the combination of the phrap assembler and consed graphic editor (Gor


72 CHAPTER 2
don et al. 1998) that complement the phred base-caller and are w idely used in academic settings. High-level commercial editors also aim to link assem bled sequences immediately to relational databases and annotation appli cations. The key features of successful editors are:
• The use of color to illustrate key features such as the different bases, qual ity scores, regions of sequence conservation, and contrasts between auto mated and manual base calls.
• The ability to view and navigate along the actual traces of the sequences being compared, and to tag ambiguities and features of interest with notes. • Easy display of the complementary strand.
• Tools for manual sequence editing, including inserting and deleting bases, without disrupting the original trace files yet propagating the edits throughout the assembly as appropriate (including adjustments to linked output files as requested by the editor).
• A flexible alignment algorithm that implements user-defined alignment parameters.
• Computation of probability scores associated with a calculated consen sus sequence. • The ability to identify potentially polymorphic sites. • Provision of tools to guide error correction.
Editing starts with the chromatogram files (for example, of the types .abi or .scf standard chromatogram format) that contain the fluorescence trace pro files for each of the four channels of a read. These files are generally left untouched by editors. They are converted to base call files by programs such as phred (which creates .phd files) that include the base calls, quality scores, peak positions, and any tagged information provided by human annota tors. If a separate assembly program such as phrap is used, it creates a third input file (.ace) that includes information on the alignment, the consensus contig sequence, and quality scores for each base in the consensus. After manual editing, multiple versions of .phd and .ace files m aybe stored, each of which can be called up later for subsequent re-editing, perhaps follow ing addition of newly obtained sequences. Consed provides a graphic interface that allows the user to call up and interactively edit individual reads and/or contigs assembled by phrap. The aligned-reads w indow shown in Figure 2.4presents the consensus sequence as well as each individual sequence that contributes to an alignment. Gray shading indicates the quality of each base call, with white indicating high quality. The user can manipulate features of the display, including the use of color to indicate quality or match, and the inclusion of tags. Navigation along a sequence is facilitated either by scroll bars or, for contigs that exceed several kilobases in length, by manual entry of numerical positions, and can be perform ed using criteria that automatically identify features such as am biguous bases, regions of poor alignment, high-quality reads that dis

agree with the consensus, and homopolymeric stretches. Editing of individ ual bases is facilitated by calling up the trace file, which allows visual com parison of two or more traces, again using a series of interactive tools. The alignment algorithms used by various assemblers are generally m od ifications of methods introduced by Needleman and Wunsch in 1970 and by Smith and Waterman in 1981; these methods are described in Box 2.1. Not all alignments of the same set of sequences are identical, primarily because they assign different default parameters—and use them differ ently— to weight the effects of insertions and deletions relative to single base mismatches. Algorithms that also use quality scores from the contribut ing sequence reads add further complexity, as does weighting attached to the frequency of mismatches. Although default settings are the easiest to use, they are not necessarily the settings most likely to yield the correct align ment. Manual inspection remains the most efficient w ay to resolve ambigu ities, but is too time-consuming to be performed on a genom e scale.


74 CHAPTER 2
BOX 2.1 Pairwise Sequence Alignment
The single most important class of bioinformatics tools are those dealing with pairwise
alignment of DNA and amino acid sequences. We shall see that pairwise sequence align
ment and database searching are essentially the same computational problem, and that
the underlying algorithms for pairwise alignment are found in a variety of other bioinfor
matics applications.
Consider the following two simple sequence alignments:
Alignm ent 1 Alignm ent 2 Sequence 1 ACGCTGA ACGCTGA Sequence 2 A— CTGT ACTGT
Intuitively, we recognize that the first alignment is "superior" to the second. Why?
Because the residues in the same column are mostly identical (four exact matches), and
there is no obvious way to improve the alignment quality. In contrast, the second align
ment has less sequence identity (three exact matches), and we can recognize the potential
improvement offered by "sliding" the CTG subsequence of sequence 2 to match the CTG
in sequence 1.
The goal of pairwise sequence alignment is to formalize this intuitive procedure. We seek
alignments that contain high levels of sequence identity, few mismatches and gaps, and little
opportunity for improvement. We will work under the assumption that the observed simi
larity in sequences to be aligned is the result of either random chance (in which case the sim
ilarity is likely of no interest) or the result of a shared evolutionary origin.
By placing residues from two sequences in the same column of an alignment, we are
implying that they are h o m o lo g o u s, meaning that the two residues are descendants of a
common ancestral residue. Homology is not to be confused with sequence identity; two
residues may be identical without being homologous. Two positions in an alignment col
umn can have any of the relationships shown in the figure. Parts C and D of Figure A
point out that it is possible to have the same true alignment arise through different evolu
tionary events; when we are dealing with pairwise alignments, the data do not allow us
to distinguish between insertion and deletion events, thus explaining the origin of the
term indel.

Figure A C om m on evolutionary even ts and their effects on alignm ent. The alignments are shown beneath diagrams of how they might occur. Two positions in an alignment may contain identical residues (A); they may hold different residues as the result of one or more substitution events (B); or one of the sequences can hold a gap or indel, the result of insertion (C) or deletion (D) events.


GENOME SEQUENCING AND ANNOTATION 75
Of course, sequences do not come to us in aligned form. We must infer the location of
past indel and substitution events. Several computational approaches for performing this
task exist, but the most widely used are score-based methods in which inferred events in
an alignment are penalized by amounts proportional to their rarity. For example, we may
assign substitutions a penalty of -1 unit, while less common indels receive a penalty of -5
units. A match (identity) might receive a score of +3 units. The score for a candidate align
ment is then the sum of the penalties at each of the positions in the alignment. Using this
scoring scheme, the four alignments in Figure A have scores of 9,5,4, and 4, respectively.
If we search through all possible alignments and compute the score for each, we can iden
tify the alignment (or alignments) with the optimal score and use it as our best guess for
the true alignment.
It is worthwhile to understand the computational approach for finding the optimal pair
wise alignment of two sequences. Understanding the algorithms enhances the ability to
work with database searching tools, and the computational approach is widely used in
many other bioinformatics tools. The problem is defined as taking as inputs two sequences
and inserting gaps into one or both of them in such a way to maximize the total alignment
score. Needleman and Wunsch (1970) described the first computationally tractable algo
rithm for finding optimal pairwise alignments. The algorithm is an example of dynamic pro
gramming, and it guarantees that we find all optimal alignments in a manner that avoids
exhaustive searching of all possible alignments of two sequences of lengths m and n.
Consider the example given at the beginning of this box, where sequence 1has 7
residues (ACGCTGA) and sequence 2has 5 residues (ACTGT). One way to find the opti
mum alignment would be to compute every possible alignment score, which is not so diffi
cult in this example but would be computationally intensive if the two sequences were ten
times longer, or if one sequence was being aligned with a database of thousands of
sequences. Instead, the Needleman-Wunsch approach uses a recursive algorithm based on
the addition of one position at a time to the best alignment of residues up to that point.
That is, if we already know the best alignment of the first (i - 1) residues of sequence 1with
the first (j - 1) residues of sequence 2, then we can quickly compute the best alignment of
residues i against j. This is because thre are only three ways to terminate the longer align
ment, illustrated as follows for alignment of the first four residues (i = j = 4):
1. Having already aligned residues 1 through (i - 1) of sequence 1and 1through (j - 1) of
sequence 2, when we add both residues i and /, we add the match score or penalty that
they generate (in this case, a penalty due to a C-G mismatch):
ACG ACGC |. (Score = 3 + 3-1= 5) —> | |. . (score = 5-1 = 4) ACT ACTG
2. Having already aligned residues 1through (i - 1) of sequence 1and 1through j of se
quence 2,when we add residue i we incur the penalty for aligning residue i with a gap:
AC-G AC-GC | |. | (Score = 3 + 3- 5 + 3 = 4)—> |. (score = 4- 5 = -1) ACTG ACTG
3. Having already aligned residues 1 through i of sequence 1and 1 through (/-l) of
sequence 2, when we add residue j, we incur the penalty for aligning a gap with
residue/:
ACGC ACGC|• (Score = 3 + 3- l - 5 = 0)—> |. (score = 0- 5 = -5) ACT- ACT-G
(Continued on next page)


76 CHAPTER 2
BOX 2.1 (continued)
Clearly, the best option was adding both residues without a gap. Formally, the score for
alignment of i residues of sequence 1against j residues of sequence 2 is given by:
S(i-1,/-1) + c(i,j) S(i,j) = max S(i-1 ) + c (i,-) S(i,;-1) + c
where c(i,j) is the score for alignment of residues i and j and takes the value 3 for a match
or -1 for a mismatch, and c(-,/) is the penalty for aligning a residue with a gap, which
takes the value -5 given the default match and penalty scores. (Note that assigning differ
ent scores may give different optimal alignments.)
We can display this algorithm using a two-dimensional matrix. The (i,j)entry in the
matrix is the best score for aligning the first i residues of sequence 1 (on the y-axis) with the
first j residues of sequence 2 (the x-axis). The optimal alignment score of two sequences of
length m and n can then be found in the upper right of the matrix, the (m,n) element.
We begin by filling in the first row and first column of the matrix, which corresponds to
initial gaps (e.g., aligning the A in sequence 2against a gap in sequence 1 costs -5; aligning
the first three positions of sequence 1against initial gaps in sequence 2 costs -15).
i =1 A -35 i =6 G - 3 0 i =5 T - 2 5 i =4 C - 2 0 i =3 G - 1 5 i =2 C - 1 0
3
-5 -10 -15 -2 0 -2 5 A C T GT 1 2 3 45
From this starting point, we can fill in each cell in the table using the algorithm. The entry
for S(l,l), is the maximum of the following three events:
S(0,0) + c(A,A)= 0 + 3 = 3 S(0,1) + c(A,-) = (-5) + (-5) = -10 S(1,0) + c(-,A) = (-5) + (-5) = -10
In a similar fashion, w e find S(2,l) as the maximum of three values: (-5)-l = -6; (3)-5 = -2; and (-10)-5 = -15. The best entry is the addition of the C indel to the A-A match, for a score of -2. If w e fill in the entire matrix, w e get the following: A -35 -27 -19 -9 -3 1 G -30 -22 -14 -4 2 2 T -25 -17 -9 -1 -1 7 C -20 -12 -4 0 4 3 G -15 -7 1 5 4 -1 C -10 -2 6 1 -4 -9

If you are having trouble following the algorithm, just imagine filling in the cells of the
matrix by exhaustively computing the best score for each alignment of i by j residues.
The first column shows what would happen if you aligned each of the i residues of
sequence 1with gaps; the second column if you aligned them against A and a series of
gaps, and so on. The entry for row i and column j indicates the optimal score for align
ing i residues of sequence 1 against j residues of sequence 2. These scores were comput
ed by iterative algorithm rather than exhaustive computations for each possibility. The
score for the optimal alignment of the whole sequences is indicated in the top right hand
comer, the (m,n) cell, in this example alignment of 7 against 5 residues having a score
of I1.n order to see what the actual alignment associated with this score looks like, we per
form a traceback step. Beginning at the upper right (m,n) element, we determine which of
the three possible "directions" was taken to reach that cell. For example, the 1in the (7,5)
cell could only be reached by the addition of the mismatch AT, the value of 1being
obtained by adding a mismatch penalty of -1 to the 2 found in the (6,4) cell. Had the (7,5)
cell been reached from the (7,4) cell, the score would have been (-3) + (-5) = -8; had it
been reached via adding an indel from the (6,5) cell the entry would have been 2 + (-5) =
-3. We will indicate the taken directions with arrows, and step our way back through the
entire matrix to the (0,0) cell.
A -3 5 -27 -1 9 -1 1 -3 ......1 G -30 -22 -14 -6 2 * 2 T -25 -17 -9 - 1 ^ " -1 7 C -20 -12 -4 0 4 3 G -15 T7^ 5 4 -1
C -10 1 -4 -9 A -5 -2 -7 -12 -17 - 0 - "" -5 -10 -15 -20 -25 - ACTGT
A cell with two arrows indicates two equally good alignments, and any continuous path
from the upper right cell to the lower left cell represents an alignment with the optimal
score. For example, the value of -4 in the (4,2) position could be obtained from either of
two directions—either by adding a penalty of -5 to the 1 in cell (3,2), or by adding a
match of 3 to the -7 in cell (3,1). Every such split doubles the number of best-scoring
alignments. In this example, this means that there is a pair of optimal alignments, each
having score 1, for these two sequences, and these are:
ACGCTGA ACGCTGA A--CTGT AC--TGT
Note that each alignment includes four matches, one mismatch, and two indels. The
ambiguity has to do with which C in sequence 1aligns with the C in sequence 2.


78 CHAPTER 2
EXERCISE 2.2 Computing an optimal sequence alignment
Compute the best possible alignment for the following two sequences, assuming a gap penalty o f -5, a mismatch penalty o f- l,and a match score o f +3. Would your answer be any different if the gap penalty was also -I (rather than -5)7
AGCGTAT and ACGGTAT
ANSWER: Three possible high-quality alignments are:
(1) AGCGTAT (2) A G C - G TA T (3) A G C G - TAT
I ••I I I I I ' M I I I 1-1 h i I I
ACGGTAT A-CGGTAT A-CGGTAT
The second and third alignments will produce the same score with these penalties, namely (6x3) - (2x5) = 8 with a gap penalty o f -5; or (6x3)-(2x1)-16 with a gap penalty of-1. By contrast, the first align ment gives a score o f (5x3)- ( 2 x l) = 13. Thus, the first alignment is best with a large gap penalty, but either o f the other two alignments would be better with the smaller gap penalty.
The final task of a sequence editor is to help resolve gaps and ambigui ties. To this end, the "Autofinish" function within Consed (Gordon et al. 2001) designs finishing reads by suggesting primers and identifying templates that will help to bridge gaps between contigs. Consed also facilitates the com parison of two or more contigs for consistency—for example, by identifying regions that may be erroneously inverted in one assembly, or contain an inser tion or site of recombination that may have generated a chimeric clone. The program will also identify local regions of poor sequence and design primers that can be used for a new round of PCR amplification and sequencing across the am biguous region. This is particularly important in a genom e project where a pre-set, genome-wide error acceptance rate has been established, as design of further experiments to improve the sequence quality can be auto mated. Once a multiple sequence alignment has been produced, a consensus sequence is derived on the basis of the quality of the reads at each position. If one or two of the reads in a contig disagree with the others, and if these reads are of low quality, the consensus will disregard them and instead reflect the high-quality sequences. Furthermore, by combining the probability scores of multiple reads, confidence in the actual consensus is greatly increased. It is this averaging of multiple reads that provides high confidence in automated DNA sequence determination and circumvents the impossibility ofmanually verifying every sequence in a genome. That is to say, in high-throughput sequencing applica tions, it is much more efficient to sequence every stretch of DNA multiple times and derive a consensus than to manually curate a single trace for each


GENOME SEQUENCING AND ANNOTATION 79
sequence. Nevertheless, most genom e sequencing projects make the origi nal trace files available for individual investigators to examine online.
Emerging Sequencing Methods: The Next Generation
Although dideoxy-based sequencing has supported the vast majority of genom e research to date, a number of novel sequencing technologies are on the horizon (Bentley 2006). Sequencing a mammalian genom e still costs $30 to $50 million, so it is not surprising that considerable investment has been made in the developm ent of technologies that will dramatically reduce sequencing costs; the target is $1,000 per human genom e by the year 2010. Three commercial platforms for genome-scale sequencing were intro duced in 2007, each with the capacity to sequence w hole bacterial genom es for just several thousand dollars. These can also be used to re-sequence strains of m odel organisms such as Drosophila or Arabidopsis, to generate profiles of mRNA abundance, or to target specific regions of mammalian chrom osom es for re-sequencing to detect polym orphism s and mutations, am ong other applications. All three of these platforms generate hundreds of megabases of sequence in a couple of days, but require high-performance com puting hardware and extreme data storage capacity. Their basic prin ciples are schematicized and com pared with traditional Sanger sequenc ing in Figure 2.5. Flash presentations demonstrating these technologies are available from the respective manufacturers' Web sites. The 454 Life Sciences platform relies on massively parallel pyrosequencing to generate millions of 100-bp reads (Margulies et al. 2005). The target DNA is fragmented and coupled to beads, which are then emulsified with a mixture of nucleotides and DNA polymerase that facilitates amplification and the deposition of millions of copies of a single fragment on a bead into a picoliter-sized chamber. The sequence on each bead is then determined by pyrosequencing (see Figure 3.21) in which nucleotide incorporation is associated with a flash of light. The four nucleotides are added sequentially in a cycle that is repeated several hundred times. Since the light intensity is proportional to the number of nucleotides incorporated at each step, the sequence is inferred from the successive intensities of light flashes associ ated with the incorporation of each nucleotide. Millions of individuals reads are then aligned with the reference genom e to which they are being com pared, or are assembled de novo into an original genom e sequence. The Illumina Genom e Analyzer uses technology originally developed by Solexa. It is conceptually similar to polony sequencing (see below), except that the cell-free clones are arrayed on an optically transparent surface. Singlestranded, 200-bp fragments of DNA are ligated to 5'and 3'adapters that are complementary to a sea of primers on the array surface. These support con version into bridges of double-stranded DNA that are amplified on the array, resulting in "microislands" of paired fragments sticking up into solution, anchored at either end. These microislands are sequenced one base at a time using fluorescently labeled dideoxynucleotides, which are read and then deprotected so that they will accept a new nucleotide in the next cycle.

(A) Traditional Sanger sequencing reads each nucleotide as labeled fragments of increasing length electrophorese past a laser detector. (B) Pyrosequencing (454 Life Sciences) captures the intensity of signal emitted as each successive nucleotide is added, with peak height proportional to the number of nucleotides in succession. (C) Reversible termi nator technology (Illumina Genome Analyzer) reads one base at a time from locally amplified cell-free clones on an optically transparent surface. (D) Ligation sequencing (ABI SOLiD) depends on inference of the sequence from incorporation of chains of 9-mer oligonucleotides. (After Bentley 2006, Figure 1.)
nucleotides are added sequentially in 50 or more cycles, starting with a primer complementary to one of the adapters. After the first reaction is completed, sequencing from the other primer supports the generation of paired 50-mer sequences. Together these sequences provide better alignment to the reference genome than a single read would. The ABI SOLiD (Supported Oligonucleotide + Ligation Detection) sys tem is a hybrid between sequencing by hybridization and primer extension on a template. Beads with amplified fragments attached to them are ana lyzed in massively parallel fashion, but the sequence is read according to a unique approach, every fifth base at a time. All possible 8-mer oligonu


GENOME SEQUENCING AND ANNOTATION
cleotides are hybridized to the template simultaneously, but only those that have a specific two-base-pair combination in the middle will bind strongly enough to the template to allow the oligonucleotide to ligate to the grow ing strand. The identity of the fifth base is then decoded according to the color of the fluorescent dye at the unligated end of the 8-mer. The last three nucleotides are cleaved off, and a new cycle of oligonucleotide hybridiza tion begins. After five to seven cycles of ligation, the newly synthesized strand is melted off and a second round of ligation cycles is initiated with a new primer that is offset from the first primer by one base. After five such rounds, the reads are merged to infer a sequence. The requirement that each oligonucleotide provides a readout of two adjacent bases ensures high accu racy of the sequence read. Assembly of the genom e sequence proceeds by computational alignment with a reference genome. An intriguing m ethod for small-laboratory scale genom e analysis is known as polony sequencing (Figure 2.6). Polonies are PCR colonies: rather than cloning a DNA m olecule into a plasm id and grow in g it in cells, or

sequencing. A dilute solution of DNA mole cules is prepared in an acrylamide matrix and plated onto a glass microscope slide. In situ PCR produces thousands of tiny colonies of DNA ("polonies"), which become templates for the incorporation of single dye-labeled dNTPs. The slide is read after each cycle of incorporation of a new base. Each polony pro duces a short (20-25 nucleotides) sequence. These short sequences are assembled compu tationally into a contiguous sequence.

amplifying it in a plastic tube, the PCR reaction is performed in the acry lamide matrix on a glass m icroscope slide. The DN A to be sequenced is greatly diluted so that single molecules form PCR templates a few microns apart from one another. This results in tens of thousands of tiny colonies of identical DNA molecules, and cycles of fluorescent nucleotide incorpora tion follow ed b y scanning of the slide in a microarray reader leads to the sequencing of several kilobases of DNA per slide. Several other approaches are under development, or are being used in specific resequencing applications. These include:
• Sequencing by hybridization (SBH) makes use of the complementarity of the two strands of DNA molecules to detect whether an exact match to an oligonucleotide is present in a sample of DNA. As described in Chap ter 3, this principle underlies variant detector arrays (VDA) that contain all possible oligonucleotides in a molecule several kilobases in length, as well as mismatches at each site. The company Perlegen has used this tech nology to resequence entire primate chrom osomes and to scan individ ual human genom es for 1.5 million SNPs. • Mass spectrophotometric (MS) techniques have been demonstrated for the sequencing of fragmented DNA molecules up to 50 bases in length. The identity of fragmented oligonucleotides can be determined by reference to the time of flight of a set of standards through a vacuum chamber. Mak ing use of advances in information theory, in principle it should be pos sible to determine the full sequence of a molecule that is divided into all possible oligonucleotides, thereby also facilitating de novo sequencing. MS methods are rapid and likely to become cost-effective. The Sequenom corporation uses this approach in massively parallel genotyping based on the differential mass of polym orphic nucleotides. • Ultrafast and relatively inexpensive sequencing of long DNA fragments might be achieved using nanopore sequencing strategies (Deamer and Akeson 2000). One approach monitors changes in electrical current as the nucleotide base blocks a tiny membrane pore as a single strand of DNA or RNA passes through it. Another, being pursued by US Genomics, chan nels the nucleic acid through a single-molecule fluorescence reader. Such methods promise to allow the sequencing of molecules hundreds of kilo bases long in just a few minutes.
• Several other single-molecule approaches still em ploy the basic Sanger approach, but avoid the reagent and liquid-handling costs associated with capillary-based automated sequencing. Pacific Biosciences use single-mol ecule real time (SMRT) technology to visualize the incorporation of each base into the grow ing complementary strand of an isolated strand of DNA. The fluorescent dyes are located on the phosphate group rather than the base of the nucleotide, and each of 10 base incorporations per second is detected in a parallel array of miniscule chambers. In theory, molecules kilobases long may be read, and it is possible this approach may lead to the generation of a human genom e sequence in 15 minutes for around $100.


GENOME SEQUENCING AND ANNOTATION 83
A plausible extension of all these emerging techniques will be the ability to obtain a thorough read-out of gene expression at the cellular level by lyzing cells and directly reading the sequences of thousands of complete mRNA molecules.
Genome Sequencing
Whole-chromosome sequences are reassembled from the sequences of hun dreds of thousands of fragments, each typically between 500 and 1,000bp in length. Two general strategies for fragmentation and reassembly are used, known as hierarchical sequencing and shotgun sequencing.* The distinc tion between them is that in the hierarchical approach, the first step is to develop a low-resolution physical alignment that is used to ensure the sequence is obtained in large ordered pieces, whereas the shotgun approach simply breaks the genome into small, sequenceable units and relies on com puter algorithms to assemble them. The difference is summarized in Figure 2.7. Most new genome sequencing projects adopt the whole-genome shotgun approach, bypassing the use of hierarchical strategies to guide assembly.

DNA molecule and moving through early sequencing developments, the first genome sequence (SV40), map-making, and proposals for the human genome project, see http://www.sciencemag.org/feature/plus/sfg/human/timelinel.dtl at Science Online.
Figure 2.7 Hierarchical versus shotgun sequencing. In hierarchical sequencing, the chromosomes are first cloned as large BAC or PI fragments up to 200 kb. These are physically ordered, and a subset that gives a minimal overlap for complete genome coverage is chosen for shotgun sequencing. In the whole-genome shotgun approach, no attempt is made to order the clones in advance. Instead, the whole genome is assembled using computer algorithms that order contigs based on their overlapping sequences.

Hierarchical Sequencing
Hierarchical strategies, which are also known as top-down, map-based, or clone-by-clone strategies, were developed in the late 1980s, at a time when the cost of chemicals was exorbitant, high-volume automated protocols had not yet been developed, and computers were not yet powerful enough to handle whole-genome shotgun sequencing. The general approach of break ing a genom e into smaller and smaller units, the relative locations of which are known before sequencing commences, had two further advantages: it fostered assembly of high-resolution physical and genetic maps; and it allow ed groups w orking around the globe to form consortia and work together without risking repetition, since each group could concentrate on a particular chromosome. The technology for cloning large fragments of genomes and maintaining them in a stable state progressed rapidly throughout the 1990s, with the result that the E. coli, S. cerevisiae, C. elegans, and A. thaliana genom e projects were the beneficiaries of ever more efficient techniques of hierarchical sequencing. The basic strategy of hierarchical sequencing remains applica ble to any organism, and in fact was the used by the publicly funded human genom e project. The first step in top-down sequencing is to clone the genom e as manage able units of som e 50-200 kilobases in length. Large insert cloning vectors include bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs, which carry up to 300 kb of DNA), PI phage-derived PAC clones (~100 kb), and smaller phage-derived cosm ids or fosmids (~50 kb). As shown in Figure 2.8, BAC and PAC clones are similar in organization to ordinary plasm id cloning vectors, with the major difference that vector-encoded sequences help keep the copy num ber close to one per cell, which limits the potential for recombination and maintains the integrity of the large clones. Special features of PAC clones allow the initiation of phage packaging during the cloning step, excision of the high-copy number plasmid sequences after bacterial infection, and induction of replication immediately prior to harvesting of DNA. D N A libraries are constructed b y partial digestion or shearing of genom ic DNA by sonication, after which the fragments are ligated into a multiple cloning site (mcs) in the vector of choice using standard recombi nant DNA procedures. The source of genom ic DNA can be the whole genome, or it can come from a chromosome isolated by pulsed-field gel elec trophoresis or some other method. Researchers typically aim for five- to ten fold redundancy, meaning that every portion of the genom e should be rep resented at least five times in the library of clones. Since each clone will have different ends, it should in principle be possible to select a scaffold of clones that form a contiguous sequence covering a w hole chrom osome— a tiling path—by aligning the regions of overlap (Figure 2.9). The tiling path can be assembled using a combination of three methods: hybridization, fingerprint ing, and end-sequencing.

Figure 2.8 Cloning vectors used in genome sequencing. Different size inserts are cloned in different types of vectors. Phagemids (A) are derivatives of Ml 3 that can shuttle between double-stranded plasmid and single-stranded bacteriophage forms. Like standard cloning plasmids (B), the multiple cloning site (mcs) into which the for eign DNA is inserted is flanked by primer binding sites for sequencing. PI clones (C) are assembled as plasmids, but are converted into phage using the cosN or LoxP
recognition sites for Ter and Cre recombinases. As with BAC clones (D), copy number within E. coli cells is kept low by use of the F plasmid origin of replication.
Hybridization. All of the clones in a library that carry a particular sequence can be identified rapidly by hybridizing a small radioactively or chemically labeled probe containing the sequence to a filter on which is printed an array

Figure 2.9 Hierarchical assembly of a sequence-contig scaffold (supercontig). A minimal tiling path through a library of aligned BAC clones that ensures complete coverage of the chromosome is chosen. After sequencing independent shotgun libraries for each BAC, small gaps in the sequenced clone contigs remain. These gaps are closed as far as possible by merging the two BAC sequences, as well as by the addition of mate-pair information (yellow) and cDNA structural information (red), which establishes the orientation and distance between cloned segments.
of tens of thousands of clones (Figure 2.10A). Robots are used to pick colonies and replica plate them on nitrocellulose membranes in high-density grids. If the sequence is unique in the genome, it should "light up" only a small number of clones, which can be compared with one another. Subse quently, the end of one of these clones can be used as a probe in a fresh screen for adjacent clones, in a procedure known as chromosome walking (see Fig ure 1.2).Alternatively, the library can be interrogated with thousands of ran dom probes from throughout the genome, leading to the generation of islands of overlapping clones that eventually will be linked by som e other method.
Fingerprinting. The most cost-effective way to assemble contigs of large insert clones is to compare and align them according to restriction digest profiles (Figure 2.10B,C). Restriction enzymes that cleave DNAat 6-bp recog nition sites cut on average just under once every 4 kb, and thus liberate between 20 and 30 fragments when used to cleave a 100-kb BAC clone.
