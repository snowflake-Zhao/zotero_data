Terminology of neck dissection (Robbins et al. 1991):
A radical neck dissection includes the removal of all ipsilateral cervical lymph node groups, i.e., lymph nodes from levels I through V (submental, submandibular, cranial jugular, medial jugular, caudal jugular, dorsal cervical nodes along the accessory nerve, and supraclavicular), and removal of the spinal accessory nerve, internal jugular vein and sternocleidomastoid muscle.
In a modified radical neck dissection the same lymph nodes are removed as in a radical neck dissection; however, one or more non-lymphatic structures are preserved.
A selective neck dissection is a neck dissection with preservation of one or more lymph node groups routinely removed in radical neck dissection.

SCOPE OF REGIONAL LYMPH NODE SURGERY

The pathology report often describes regional lymph nodes by their anatomic location: colic nodes; mesenteric nodes; peri-\epi-\para-\ colic. Regional lymph nodes differ for each anatomical subsite. The following list identifies the regional lymph nodes for each subsite of the colon:

Cecum and appendix

Anterior cecal Ileocolic Posterior cecal Right colic

Ascending colon

Ileocolic Middle colic Right colic

Hepatic flexure

Middle colic Right colic

Transverse colon

Middle colic

Splenic flexure Descending colon Sigmoid colon

Inferior mesenteric Middle colic Left colic
Inferior mesenteric Left colic Sigmoid
Inferior mesenteric Sigmoid mesenteric Sigmoidal Superior rectal (hemorrhoidal)

Superior mesenteric, external iliac and common iliac nodes are distant lymph nodes. Code the removal of any of these nodes in the data item “Surgery of Other Regional Site(s), Distant Site(s), or Distant Lymph Node(s).”

Terminology of neck dissection (Robbins et al. 1991):
A radical neck dissection includes the removal of all ipsilateral cervical lymph node groups, i.e., lymph nodes from levels I through V (submental, submandibular, cranial jugular, medial jugular, caudal jugular, dorsal cervical nodes along the accessory nerve, and supraclavicular), and removal of the spinal accessory nerve, internal jugular vein and sternocleidomastoid muscle.
In a modified radical neck dissection the same lymph nodes are removed as in a radical neck dissection; however, one or more non-lymphatic structures are preserved.
A selective neck dissection is a neck dissection with preservation of one or more lymph node groups routinely removed in radical neck dissection.

Cervical, ipsilateral preauricular, submandibular, and supraclavicular Ipsilateral axillary Ipsilateral epitrochlear and axillary Ipsilateral inguinal Ipsilateral inguinal Ipsilateral inguinal and popliteal

There are boundary zones between the subsites (i.e., between the thorax and arm, the boundary zone is the shoulder and axilla). The boundary zones do not belong to either subsite. If a tumor originates in one of these 4 cm boundary zones, the nodes on either side of the bands are regional.

THYROID GLAND C73.9

SCOPE OF REGIONAL LYMPH NODE SURGERY The regional lymph nodes are the cervical and upper mediastinal lymph nodes.

Terminology of neck dissection (Robbins et al. 1991):
A radical neck dissection includes the removal of all ipsilateral cervical lymph node groups, i.e., lymph nodes from levels I through V (submental, submandibular, cranial jugular, medial jugular, caudal jugular, dorsal cervical nodes along the accessory nerve, and supraclavicular), and removal of the spinal accessory nerve, internal jugular vein and sternocleidomastoid muscle.
In a modified radical neck dissection the same lymph nodes are removed as in a radical neck dissection; however, one or more non-lymphatic structures are preserved.
A selective neck dissection is a neck dissection with preservation of one or more lymph node groups routinely removed in radical neck dissection.
