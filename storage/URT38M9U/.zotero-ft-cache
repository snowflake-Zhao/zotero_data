Summary
Background Radiotherapy is the mainstay of treatment for nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Radiation-induced temporal lobe injury (TLI) can regress or resolve in the early phase, but it is irreversible at a later stage. However, no study has proposed a risk-based follow-up schedule for its early detection. Planning evaluation is difﬁcult when dosevolume histogram (DVH) parameters are similar and optimization is terminated.

Methods This multicenter retrospective study included 6065 patients between 2014 and 2018. A 3D ResNet-based deep learning model was developed in training and validation cohorts and independently tested using concordance index in internal and external test cohorts. Accordingly, the patients were stratiﬁed into risk groups, and the model-predicted risks were used to develop risk-based follow-up schedules. The schedule was compared with the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) recommendation (every 3 months during the ﬁrst 2 years and every 6 months in 3–5 years). Additionally, the model was used to evaluate plans with similar DVH parameters.

Findings Our model achieved concordance indexes of 0.831, 0.818, and 0.804, respectively, which outperformed conventional prediction models (all P < 0.001). The temporal lobes in all the cohorts were stratiﬁed into three groups with discrepant TLI-free survival. Personalized follow-up schedules developed for each risk group could detect TLI 1.9 months earlier than the RTOG recommendation. According to a higher median predicted 3-year TLI-free survival (99.25% vs. 99.15%, P < 0.001), the model identiﬁed a better plan than previous models.

Interpretation The deep learning model predicted TLI more precisely. The model-determined risk-based follow-up schedule detected the TLI earlier. The planning evaluation was reﬁned because the model identiﬁed a better plan with a lower risk of TLI.

Research in context
Evidence before this study We searched PubMed on February 24, 2020 for the ﬁrst time and refreshed on December 20, 2022 using the terms "temporal lobe injury" AND ("nasopharyngeal carcinoma" OR "nasopharyngeal cancer") without language restriction. This search yielded 34 results, but no study focused on risk-based follow-up schedule to detect temporal lobe injury early.
Added value of this study First, we developed and externally tested a deep learning model to precisely predict the monthly risk of temporal lobe injury based on 6065 patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma from four hospitals. The model stratiﬁed temporal lobes into different risk groups. A subsequent risk-based follow-up schedule developed based on the model could

detect temporal lobe injury 1.9 months earlier than the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group recommendation. The model could identify a better radiotherapy plan even though the plans had similar dose-volume histogram parameters and were mixed with previous models.
Implications of all the available evidence Radiotherapy planning evaluation was improved using the deep learning model with a speciﬁc risk of temporal lobe injury instead of delphic dose–volume histogram parameters. An optimal radiotherapy plan is more feasible via replanning and reevaluation, possibly reducing the risk of injury. If there is still a high risk of injury or injury is inevitable, we suggest examining the temporal lobe on the model-determined riskbased schedule for early detection.

Introduction
Nasopharyngeal carcinoma is an epithelial carcinoma that arises from the nasopharyngeal mucosal lining. It is highly sensitive to ionizing radiation, and radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy instead of surgery is the mainstay treatment modality for this disease.1 Survivors are always at risk of radiation-induced temporal lobe injuries. Studies2,3 showed that edema develops ﬁrst in the temporal lobes followed by contrast enhancement. Cysts or necrosis are the least frequent manifestations that occur at the late stage of injury. The injury may be asymptomatic in the early phase, but most patients may have headache (41.7%) and dizziness (38.9%).3 These non-speciﬁc symptoms might poorly prompt a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) if physicians do not have a high index of suspicion for temporal lobe injury. Therefore, timely diagnosis of injury is still difﬁcult, even though patients have correlated symptoms. Unfortunately, when life-threatening epilepsy, convulsions, intracranial hemorrhage, and herniation are present,4 contrast enhancement possibly extends to the lateral border of the temporal lobe and cysts or necrosis occur.3 However, there are a few drugs to treat the injury, including anti-inﬂammatory and antioxidant stress medications (e.g., corticosteroids,4 edaravone,5 and biotin6), antiapoptotic medications (e.g., Kukoamine A7), and anti-microvascular injury medications (e.g.,

bevacizumab8). Non-medical therapeutics, such as hyperbaric oxygen therapy,9 may also improve the symptoms of injury. Reducing edema is effective, but regressing the lesions and recovering impaired function is difﬁcult or impossible when the injury progresses to cysts or necrosis. Early detection of MRI abnormalities, such as edema, made it possible to prevent the injury evolution and delay the impairment of function by early intervention.
A rational imaging follow-up schedule would be invaluable for early detection, except for improved diagnostic accuracy due to advances in imaging techniques, such as resting-state functional magnetic resonance.10 Currently, temporal lobes are only examined incidentally in the plan to surveil tumor recurrences, such as the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) recommendation of 14 times and most intensive National Comprehensive Cancer Network suggestion of 27 visits. However, the injury risk may be discrepant across patients and vary over time for identical patients, and the rhythms of tumor recurrence and temporal lobe injury may differ. Therefore, early detection of temporal lobe injury, discovering the regularity of temporal lobe injury over time, stratifying patients into different risk groups, and developing a risk-based follow-up schedule may be helpful.

nomogram,12 and our dosiomics model that utilized the spatial dose distribution and dose-volume histogram (DVH) parameters13 showed high predictive efﬁciency and could stratify patients. However, they failed to predict the monthly risk of temporal lobe injury and impossibly guided individualized follow-up. A new model with precise predictions is required to solve these problems.
Additionally, optimizing a radiotherapy plan is the basis for minimizing injuries. Currently, planners’ empirical effort in reducing injury is evaluated by the DVH parameters of the temporal lobes, such as the QUANTEC model (Dmax<60 Gy)14 or Wen’s nomogram,11 in daily clinical practice. Corresponding plan modiﬁcations may result in the optimization of DVH parameters, but the temporal lobe injury rate or grade remains unknown. Hence, the new model must be competent in the daily evaluation of treatment plans, especially when DVH parameters are similar.
Herein, we developed and tested a deep learning model based on clinical variables, DVH parameters, spatial dose distribution, and computed tomography (CT)-based features of the temporal lobes to precisely predict the monthly risk of radiation-induced temporal lobe injury. We then used the model to stratify patients and establish a risk-based follow-up schedule to detect injuries early. We also investigated whether the model could identify a better radiotherapy plan in daily clinical practice of planning evaluation.
Methods
Ethics statement This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center (No. B2020-264-01 and No. B2017-013-01). Patient informed consent was waived in the retrospective cohort, but was obtained in the prospective cohort. All clinical investigations were conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.
Patients Based on the inclusion criteria elucidated in the Supplementary Methods, 5100 patients with histopathology-conﬁrmed nasopharyngeal carcinoma were retrospectively and consecutively included from four hospitals in China: the Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center (SYSUCC cohort, 3710 patients, 2014/ 01–2015/12), Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital (SYSMH test cohort, 201 patients, 2015/12–2018/10), First People’s Hospital of Foshan (Foshan test cohort, 1061 patients, 2014/01–2016/12), and Cancer Center of the Fifth Afﬁliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University (Zhuhai test cohort, 128 patients, 2015/11–2017/07). We randomly divided patients in the SYSUCC cohort into training (3146 patients) and validation (564 patients) cohorts to develop a deep learning model.

Patients from the other three hospitals were used as external test cohorts (1390 patients) to evaluate the external generalization ability of the model. Additionally, 965 participants included in the prospective observational study (NCT03003182) were enrolled into the internal test cohort (2017/05–2017/12) (Fig. 1a). All the patients received intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), with or without systemic treatment. The details are speciﬁed in the Supplementary Methods section.
Surrogate assessment of functional temporal lobe injury Similar to previous studies,11,12,15 MRI-based temporal lobe radiologic changes,2 including edema (ﬁnger-like lesions of increased signal intensity in T2-weighted images), contrast enhancement (enhanced lesions with or without necrosis in T1-weighted [T1-w] images), and cyst or necrosis (very high signal intensity on T2weighted (T2-w) images with round or oval lesions), were used as a surrogate assessment of functional temporal lobe injury in all patients in the training, validation, internal, and external test cohorts. A radiation oncologist (OYPY, over 10 years of experience in nasopharyngeal carcinoma) and radiologist (HY, interpretation of MRI images in over 500 patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma per month for over 5 years) independently evaluated the MRI images at each visit after radiotherapy. Disagreements in diagnosis were resolved by consensus. Representative examples are presented in Supplementary Fig. S1.
Planning CT and MRI protocols All patients were immobilized in the supine position using a head-neck-shoulder thermoplastic mask. Planning CT images with and without contrast were obtained from the head to 2 cm below the sternoclavicular joint with 3 mm slices, a matrix size of 512 × 512, and voxel resolution of 0.97 × 0.97 × 3.0 mm in the left-right, anteroposterior, and craniocaudal directions.
All the patients underwent head and neck MRI with 1.5-T or 3.0-T unit (Siemens, Germany; Philips, Netherlands; GE, USA) for cancer diagnosis, staging, and imaging follow-up. The images were scanned using a head-neck combined coil. The scan ranged from the suprasellar cistern to the inferior margin of the sternal end of the clavicle. The MRI examinations included unenhanced T1-and T2-w sequences, and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted (CET1-w) and fat-suppressed CET1-w sequences. Contrast-enhanced sequences were obtained after intravenous injection of 0.1 mmol/kg of body weight of gadodiamide (Omniscan, GE Healthcare Ireland, Cork, Ireland) or gadolinium-diethylenetriamine penta-acetic acid (Magnevist; Bayer Schering Pharma AG, Germany).

T-stage, and concurrent chemotherapy) and 18 DVH parameters (standardized to an equivalent dose of 2 Gy per fraction using the linear quadratic model16) that were predictive of temporal lobe injury-free survival (Supplementary Table S1). Baseline images of planning CT and spatial dose distribution of the temporal lobe were cropped according to their contours segmented by YSS and veriﬁed by OYPY as previously recommended.17 After normalization, baseline images of planning CT, dose distribution, and shapes of the temporal lobe were concatenated and added into 3D ResNet18 to extract image feature f. Image feature f, clinical variables, and 18 DVH parameters were concatenated and simultaneously added into the multilayer perceptron to develop the deep learning model after comparing their performance in predicting the injury in the validation cohort (Supplementary Table S2). Each temporal lobe’s injured or unwounded state, latencies of MRI-based temporal lobe injury after radiotherapy for the injured lobes, and intervals between

the last MRI examination and radiotherapy for the unwounded lobes were used as training outcomes. The details are shown in the Supplementary Methods, and the trained model was uploaded to GitHub (https:// github.com/genhao3/TLI). Finally, the prediction model outputs the monthly chance of temporal lobe injury over 60 months (Fig. 1b). The total risk Ri of ith instance was calculated as Ri = ∑6m0=1P(m)⋅rm, where rm denoted the risk of mth month, and P(.) was a linear function, which deﬁned that the risk of temporal lobe injury occurring earlier was more signiﬁcant than that occurring later (Supplementary Fig. S2).
Risk-based follow-up schedule The temporal lobes in the training cohort were stratiﬁed into low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups based on the 50% and 85% quantiles of the predicted 5-year total risk Ri by the deep learning model. The threshold corresponding to the quantiles was then tested in the other cohorts for risk stratiﬁcation.

Generally, the more likely the injury would occur in a speciﬁc month, the more follow-up visits should be distributed, regardless of the risk groups. Therefore, the monthly follow-up was the product of the monthly predicted temporal lobe injury probability and total number of visits. Follow-up visits were scheduled according to cumulative monthly follow-up values. If a total of 14 visits, as recommended by the RTOG, were set for a temporal lobe, a visit would be scheduled in the month when the cumulative follow-ups exceeded 0.74, or else no visit was scheduled. Once a visit was planned for a given month, cumulative follow-ups returned to zero and follow-ups were accumulated from the next month. A temporal lobe in the high-risk group of the training cohort was used as an example, and its schedule of 14 visits is presented in Supplementary Table S3. The total number of visits ranged from the least ﬁve times (once every year) to a maximum of 27. The schedules established for each risk group in the training cohort were tested in other cohorts.
To evaluate the effectiveness of different schedules, we calculated the delayed months for temporal lobes with injury, deﬁned as the duration from the actual injury time to the next-nearest planned follow-up visit. For example, if a temporal lobe experienced temporal lobe injury in the 38th month, while the next most immediate planned visit was in the 42nd month, temporal lobe injury follow-up was delayed by 4 months, and the delayed months were four. As we limited the analysis to 60 months, the temporal lobes were excluded if temporal lobe injury occurred beyond 60 months. Delayed months were considered the duration from the temporal lobe injury time to the 60th month if the temporal lobe injury was diagnosed after the scheduled visit. The RTOG recommendation of 14 visits (every 3 months during the ﬁrst 2 years and every 6 months in years 3–5) was set as the control for comparison in the validation, internal test, and external test cohorts because it was applied at our center.
Statistical analysis Similar to the QUANTEC model14 and Wen’s nomogram,11 our endpoint was survival free from temporal lobe injury (temporal lobe injury-free survival). It was calculated from the start of radiotherapy to the occurrence of MRI-based temporal lobe injury or the ﬁnal examination, if negative. Bilateral temporal lobes were evaluated separately, and temporal lobe-based rather than patient-based analyses were conducted. Therefore, a patient had two different temporal lobe injury-free survival values if the unilateral lobe had temporal lobe injury, or if the temporal lobe injury of the bilateral temporal lobes occurred at different times. Alternatively, a patient’s temporal lobe injury-free survival value was the same for both temporal lobes.
The performance of the models in the validation, internal test, and external test cohorts was evaluated

using Harrell’s concordance index (C-index)19 and compared using the Log likelihood ratio test. Calibration curves and decision curve analyses were used to evaluate the consistency between the predicted and observed risks and clinical usefulness of the models. Temporal lobe injury-free survival rates of the different risk groups were compared using the Kaplan–Meier with the logrank test. We reported the median predicted survival rates of the two radiotherapy plans and median delayed months on different schedules given the skewed distribution identiﬁed by the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test and then compared them using the related samples Wilcoxon rank test.
Statistical analysis was performed using the R software (https://cran.r-project.org/). Statistical signiﬁcance was set at a P value of <0.05 was signiﬁcant.

Results
Patients As shown in Fig. 1a and Table 1, 6065 patients were included in the study. In the training, validation, internal test cohorts, SYSMH, Foshan, and Zhuhai test cohorts, 8.2% (519/6292), 7.5% (85/1128), 9.0% (174/ 1930), 4.0% (16/402), 6.4% (135/2122), and 5.1% (13/ 256) of the temporal lobes had radiation-induced injuries, respectively, and the 3-year temporal lobe injuryfree survival rates were 94.4%, 95.2%, 93.0%, 97.6%, 96.3%, and 97.6%, respectively. Owing to the small number of injured temporal lobes, the SYSMH, Foshan, and Zhuhai test cohorts were grouped as external test cohorts for subsequent analysis.
Development and test of the deep learning model The deep learning model achieved C-indexes of 0.793 (95% CI, 0.774–0.813), 0.831 (95% CI, 0.786–0.869), 0.818 (95% CI, 0.785–0.849), and 0.804 (95% CI, 0.768–0.840) in the training, validation, internal test, and external test cohorts, respectively. Calibration curves indicated consistency between the predicted and actual temporal lobe injury-free survival rates in all the cohorts (Supplementary Fig. S3). The C-indexes of the deep learning model were higher than those of Wen’s model (0.769 [95% CI, 0.725–0.814], 0.769 [95% CI, 0.733–0.801], and 0.787 [95% CI, 0.754–0.816]), and the QUANTEC model (0.520 [95% CI, 0.500–0.534], 0.539 [95% CI, 0.532–0.547], and 0.551 [95% CI, 0.537–0.562]) in the validation, internal test, and external test cohorts, which showed its superiority in predicting temporal lobe injury-free survival (all P < 0.001, Fig. 2).

curve analysis supported the considerable net beneﬁt of the deep learning model (Supplementary Fig. S4).
Deep learning model in risk-based follow-up schedule The training cohort was stratiﬁed into three groups, 2.0% (66/3146), 10.8% (240/2202), and 22.5% (213/ 944), of which the temporal lobes had radiologic changes, and the 5-year temporal lobe injury-free survival rate of group I was the highest (96.81%), followed by group II (80.64%, P < 0.001) and group III (53.85%, P < 0.001) (Fig. 3a). Based on the same stratiﬁcation threshold, signiﬁcant differences in the 5-year temporal lobe injury-free survival rates were also observed between the three groups in the validation, internal, and external test cohorts (all P < 0.001, Fig. 3b–d).
As predicted by the deep learning model, the incidence of temporal lobe injury was extremely low for the temporal lobes at low risk, and the curves in all the

cohorts were relatively ﬂat with no prominent peak. The incidence of the temporal lobes at intermediate risk was much higher than that at low risk, especially 2 years after radiotherapy. Nonetheless, temporal lobes at increased risk may experience radiologic changes even within 2 years, and they have a much higher incidence of radiation-induced injury than those at intermediate risk. A sharp rise in the probability of temporal lobe injury over time was observed in the high-risk group (Supplementary Fig. S5).
Subsequently, we assigned multiple visits (5–27) to speciﬁc months according to the predicted monthly temporal lobe injury probabilities. Consequently, the median number of delayed months gradually decreased as the total number of assigned visits increased in all the risk groups, as shown in Fig. 4. Signiﬁcantly, if the highrisk group’s temporal lobes were followed up 14 times on the deep learning-based schedule, the median delayed months were shortened to 1.3, 1.0, and 1.4

months in the validation, internal test, and external test cohorts, respectively. In contrast, the median delayed months were 2.8, 2.0, and 3.1 months on the RTOGrecommended schedule (P ≤ 0.002). Additionally, the superiority of the deep learning-based schedule in earlier detection of temporal lobe injury was also observed for temporal lobes at intermediate and low risks, despite not being signiﬁcantly distinct from that of the RTOG schedule in the external test cohorts (1.6 vs. 1.9, P = 0.071 and 1.8 vs. 2.3, P = 0.084, respectively). Therefore, the deep learning model highly suggests imaging follow-up on the risk-based schedule, as depicted in Fig. 5.
Deep learning model in daily radiotherapy plan evaluation We randomly selected 100 patients from the internal test cohort to mimic the application of the deep learning model in daily planning evaluation. Their basic characteristics are listed in Supplementary Table S4. A new radiotherapy plan was simulated with the same dose prescription for the tumor and dose constraints to the organs at risk as the clinically used plan for each patient. As shown in Fig. 6a, the two plans had similar standardized Dmax and D0.5cc but not the same dose distribution for the identical temporal lobe of the

representative example. Consequently, both the Wen’s and QUANTEC models failed to choose the right plans for the 100 patients because of the unchangeable age and T-stage and similar classiﬁcation of the standardized D0.5cc (</≥65.06 Gy) or Dmax (</≥60 Gy) to the same temporal lobe. However, as predicted by the deep learning model, the monthly risk of temporal lobe injury differed between the plans (Fig. 6b). As the accuracy of the deep learning model in predicting 3-year temporal lobe injury-free survival rates had been demonstrated above, the 100 clinically used plans generated 200 model-predicted values for these patients, as did the 100 simulated plans. Given that the median predicted values by the 100 clinically used plans were signiﬁcantly higher than those by the 100 simulated plans using the related samples’ Wilcoxon signed-rank test (99.25% [96.86–99.90%] vs. 99.15% [97.12–99.90%, P < 0.001) (Fig. 6c), the deep learning model recommended the clinically used plans for the 100 patients.
Discussion
Based on 6065 patients from four hospitals, we developed and tested a deep learning model that could precisely predict the risk of radiation-induced temporal lobe injury with a C-index of 0.793 (95% CI 0.774–0.813).

Fig. 3: Kaplan–Meier curves for temporal lobe injury (TLI)-free survival in the different risk groups stratiﬁed by the deep learning model in the training (a), validation (b), internal test (c), and external test (d) cohorts. Group I, low-risk group; Group II, intermediate-risk group; Group III, high-risk group.

The developed model performed much better than the clinically used QUANTEC model and Wen’s nomogram (P < 0.001) in the validation, internal test, and external test cohorts. The temporal lobes were stratiﬁed into three groups with discrepancies in the temporal lobe injury-free survival (e.g., 96.81% vs. 80.64% vs. 53.85%, P < 0.001). On the follow-up schedules developed for each risk group, temporal lobe injury could be detected earlier than using the RTOG recommendation with shortened median delayed months, especially for temporal lobes at intermediate (e.g., 1.3 vs. 3.1, P < 0.001) and high (e.g., 1.4 vs. 3.1, P < 0.001) risks. Besides, this model could also identify a better radiotherapy plan with a higher median predicted 3-year temporal lobe injuryfree survival rate (99.25% vs. 99.15%, P < 0.001), which current models mixed.
Radiation mainly determines the occurrence and latency of temporal lobe injuries in nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients. A patient’s bilateral lobes may have injuries at different times, or only a unilateral temporal lobe injury is observed. Therefore, bilateral lobe injuries do not totally depend on each other, even though they come from the same patient. Radiation oncologists independently evaluated DVH parameters of the bilateral temporal lobes by default in clinical practice. Hence, the temporal lobe injury-free survival rates for bilateral temporal lobes were analyzed separately in our

study, similar to all previous studies.3,11–13,15,16,20,21 Notably, the training and validation cohorts were randomly divided by patients instead of the temporal lobes to avoid the repeated use of clinical variables in both training and validation. Age, chemotherapy, intrinsic susceptibility to radiation, and other diseases of a patient may simultaneously affect injury of the bilateral temporal lobes and result in correlated data. However, this effect is secondary and impossible to be eliminated. We selected the clinical variables in the univariate analysis and then added them into the deep learning model. The temporal lobe-based analysis showed outcomes consistent with observations in clinical practice; thus, the resultant deep learning model was more likely to be applied by clinicians.
Similar to radiotherapy-associated pulmonary toxicity,22 the probability of temporal lobe injury gradually increased over time, as shown in Supplementary Fig. S5. In contrast, the peak time of tumor recurrence or metastasis was around 15th month after radiotherapy.23 Rhythms of the temporal lobe injury and tumor recurrence were quite different. As shown in a prior study,11 we also observed heterogeneous injury risks across the temporal lobes of different patients. Consistent with the ﬁndings of a surveillance strategy for tumor recurrence,23 delays in detecting temporal lobe injury would decrease with increment of follow-up

visits, regardless of the risk group. Importantly, our deep learning model, for the ﬁrst time, precisely predicted the monthly risk of temporal lobe injury, and then specially formulated the risk-based follow-up schedule for early injury detection. Concerning the currently adopted RTOG follow-up recommendation, our deep learning model-based schedule could signiﬁcantly reduce delays in detecting temporal lobe injury at the same 14 visits for temporal lobes, especially for

those at intermediate and high risk. Consequently, the injury was likely to be seen 1.9 months earlier if the riskbased schedule was followed, independent of the schedule for surveilling tumor recurrence. Indeed, the superiority in earlier detection was slight in the low-risk group, possibly because of the rare occurrence within 60 months after radiotherapy. Notably, if two independent schedules were executed to survey the injury and tumor recurrence, the inconvenience of frequent visits and

additional costs would be inevitable. Perhaps it would be

more advisable for high-risk patients to consider socio-

economic issues.

Since 93.8% (11,372/12,130) of the temporal lobes

were irradiated with Dmax >60 Gy, as observed in our study, the QUANTEC model is incompetent in evalu-

ating and optimizing the plans in the clinic. Other

var-

iables (e.g., age, T-stage)11,26 performed better in fore-

casting the risk, despite their cutoff values varying

across different studies and lacking external veriﬁca-

tion. Recently, MRI-based radiomics features of the

temporal lobes were extracted into the prediction

model, which showed persuasive prediction perfor-

mance.12,15 Radiomics features may correspond to the

intrinsic susceptibility of the temporal lobe to radia-

tion, as demonstrated by the Genome-Wide Associa-

tion Study.27 Nonetheless, only DVH parameters and

other information derived from the radiotherapy plan

were factors that clinicians could tune. Studies have

indicated that dose distribution could complement

DVH parameters in predicting radiation-induced

xerostomia28 and gastrointestinal and genitourinary

toxicities.29 Its role in predicting temporal lobe injury

was investigated in a recent study.13 In contrast, we

used the deep learning algorithm in the present study

to integrate multidimensional data, including clinical

variables, DVH parameters,11,16,30,31 CT-derived radio-

mics features, and spatial dose distribution. As a result,

our deep learning model outperformed both the Wen’s

and QUANTEC models in prediction. As shown in

Fig. 6a, the traditional planning optimizers would

generate plans with similar DVH parameters. With the

unchangeable age, T-stage, or other clinical and tumor

factors for the same patient, previous models11,12,14

failed to identify the best plan and impossibly guided

corresponding modiﬁcations. Instead, our deep

learning model signiﬁcantly predicted the different

median temporal lobe injury-free survival rates for the

two plans, testiﬁed again the value of utilizing the

ignored spatial dose distribution and CT-based radio-

mics, and showed how to assist clinicians in choosing

the optimal plan. Although it is still unclear how CT-

based radiomics features and spatial dose distribution

should be implemented in the conventional planning

optimizer, it is an essential step in the right direction

for automated planning. With the development of deep

learning-based automated planning, patient-speciﬁc

dose distribution is available,32–34 and so is dose

distribution-based auto-optimization.35

The main limitation was that the deep learning

model was not available for predicting injuries beyond

60 months. However, 88.4% (459/519), 91.8% (78/85),

98.9% (172/174), and 87.8% (144/164) of injuries in the

training, validation, internal test, and external test

cohorts, respectively, occurred within 60 months. Some patients were followed-up for <3 years or even 18 months, which is a limitation of the retrospective design of this study. However, the median follow-up time for these cohorts was >36 months. According to a previous study with a median follow-up time of 76 months,16 93% (27/29) of patients developed injury within 60 months, and the median latency from IMRT until the ﬁrst temporal lobe injury was 33 months. Second, due to the shallow ﬂat risk of injury over time and insufﬁcient representative cases in group I, the schedule for this group was greatly scattered and possibly had considerable bias. Third, temporal lobe injury was deﬁned by radiologic changes rather than functional deﬁcits, which may have overestimated the incidence of this toxicity, but beneﬁted early diagnosis and screening. Moreover, temporal lobe injury was not stratiﬁed by severity to simplify the analysis on one hand and the other because edema and contrast enhancement are likely to remain static, regress, or even resolve if intervention is in time.2 Computed tomography-based radiomics features were extracted into the model instead of MRI-based radiomics features because MRI images were unavailable in the external cohorts. Since it was unknown which parameters were actually utilized by the deep learning model, the results of comparing the multimodal models using the Log likelihood ratio test might be biased. But C-indexes already indicated the merit of these models. Most patients came from endemic regions; therefore, the ﬁndings need further conﬁrmation in other nonendemic areas.
In conclusion, the deep learning model based on clinical variables, DVH parameters, spatial dose distribution, and CT-based radiomics features predicted the risk of MRI-based temporal lobe injury more precisely. The personalized risk-based imaging follow-up schedule determined by the model can detect the injury earlier. According to the model prediction, patients should be examined on the model-determined schedule if the injury has a high risk. The model provides a new way to evaluate radiotherapy plans in daily clinical practice with a speciﬁc risk of temporal lobe injury instead of delphic dose–volume histogram parameters. Therefore, a better radiotherapy plan with a reduced injury risk would be more feasible via corresponding replanning and reevaluation by planners and radiation oncologists.
