Introduction: Chronic coronary artery disease (CAD) management often relies on myocardial contrast echocardiography (MCE), yet
its effectiveness is limited by subjective interpretations and difficulty in distinguishing hibernating from necrotic myocardium. This
study explores the integration of machine learning (ML) with radiomics to predict functional recovery in dyskinetic myocardial
segments in CAD patients undergoing revascularization, aiming to overcome these limitations.
Methods: This prospective study enrolled 55 chronic CAD patients, dividing into training (39 patients, 205 segments) and testing sets
(16 patients, 68 segments). Dysfunctional myocardial segments were identified by initial wall motion scores (WMS) of ≥2 (hypokin
esis or higher). Functional recovery was defined as a decrease of ≥1 grade in WMS during follow-up echocardiography. Radiomics
features were extracted from dyssynergic segments in end-systolic phase MCE images across five cardiac cycles post- “flash” impulse
and processed through a five-step feature selection. Four ML classifiers were trained and compared using these features and MCE
parameters, to identify the optimal model for myocardial recovery prediction.
Results: Functional improvement was noted in 139 out of 273 dyskinetic segments (50.9%) following revascularization. Receiver
Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis determined that myocardial blood flow (MBF) was the most precise clinical predictor of
recovery, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.770. Approximately 1.34 million radiomics features were extracted, with nine
features identified as key predictors of myocardial recovery. The random forest (RF) model, integrating MBF values and radiomics
features, demonstrated superior predictive accuracy over other ML classifiers. Validation of the RF model on the testing dataset
demonstrated its effectiveness, evidenced by an AUC of 0.821, along with consistent calibration and clinical utility.
Conclusion: The integration of ML with radiomics from MCE effectively predicts myocardial recovery in CAD. The RF model,
combining radiomics and MBF values, presents a non-invasive, precise approach, significantly enhancing CAD management.

Introduction
In patients with chronic coronary artery disease (CAD), not all viable myocardium regains contractile function after
revascularization. Myocardium that can partially or fully recover contractile function is termed hibernating myocardium
(HM).1 The presence of HM is a key factor in functional recovery post-revascularization.2,3 Revascularization in
myocardial segments without recovery potential offers neither therapeutic benefit nor clinical improvement, and it
increases the risks of procedural complications and healthcare costs.4,5 Therefore, detailed assessment of myocardial
viability is essential to target potentially recoverable myocardium and enhance the efficacy of CAD interventions.

It is known that myocardial perfusion imaging is crucial for identifying HM. Positron emission tomography (PET) is
considered the gold standard for assessing myocardial viability, as it reflects regional myocardial blood flow.6 However,
the high cost of PET scanners and the use of radioactive tracers, which pose potential risks to patients and require
specialized facilities and stringent protocols, limit its widespread application in routine clinical practice. In contrast,
myocardial contrast echocardiography (MCE) is increasingly recognized for its ability to identify HM. Recommended by
the European Society of Cardiology for initial screening in patients suspected of myocardial ischemia,7 MCE utilizes safe
and non-toxic microbubble contrast agents to provide insights into myocardial perfusion. By highlighting areas with
preserved microcirculation indicative of HM, MCE effectively visualizes myocardial perfusion and viability.
Additionally, MCE equipment does not require complex infrastructure, making it accessible in most hospital settings.
These attributes significantly lower the barriers to its clinical application, enabling broader and more routine use in
developing revascularization strategies for chronic CAD.
Recent studies have highlighted the value of MCE in predicting myocardial recovery following the restoration of
normal blood flow in CAD patients.8–10 Despite these significant contributions, MCE is confronted with inherent
limitations. Its reliance on visual interpretation can introduce subjectivity, potentially resulting in variable outcomes
across different operators. This reliance on manual analysis renders the process time-intensive and susceptible to human
error, both in data acquisition and interpretation phases. Moreover, there is evidence suggesting that the visual
interpretation of MCE might overestimate the severity of myocardial ischemia, potentially leading to inaccurate
prognostic evaluations.11,12 This risk of overestimation highlights the importance for more objective and reliable methods
in evaluating myocardial viability post-revascularization to ensure appropriate therapeutic interventions.
Radiomics, a novel approach in medical imaging endorsed by the European Society of Radiology,13 addresses the
limitations of traditional MCE. By extracting quantitative features from digital images, radiomics transitions from
subjective visual interpretations to objective, data-driven analysis.14 This technique has potential applications in various
medical imaging areas, offering more detailed and nuanced information extraction which could, theoretically, enhance
diagnostic accuracy and prognostic assessments.15 However, the challenge with radiomics lies in its generation of large,
complex datasets. Integration of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly machine learning (ML), is essential to manage
and interpret these datasets.16 ML algorithms can identify clinically relevant parameters, potentially improving analyses
in medical imaging contexts.17 Recent studies have shown the effectiveness of integrating ML in medical imaging,
indicating a potential for improved diagnostic performance and outcome prediction.18,19 While the synergistic potential
of radiomics and ML is promising,20 research into their combined application in specific areas like MCE for CAD
patients is still developing. These technologies hold the possibility for advancements in chronic CAD management, but
further exploration is needed to fully establish their clinical effectiveness and relevance in improving the accuracy of
myocardial recovery predictions after revascularization.
Therefore, the objective of this study is to address the existing gaps by developing and validating an ML model based
on radiomics from MCE, enhancing myocardial recovery prediction in chronic CAD patients after revascularization. This
study aims to refine and personalize CAD treatment strategies by leveraging the objective, data-driven insights provided
by radiomics combined with the predictive power of ML.

significance level was employed. The software estimated that a minimum of 191 dyssynergic myocardial segments would
be necessary to detect significant effects.
Study Population
Between July 2020 and July 2022, 77 patients with chronic CAD and resting left ventricular dysfunction were recruited
for this study. These participants were all scheduled for coronary revascularization procedures. The inclusion criteria for
this study were as follows: 1) significant coronary artery stenosis, defined as greater than 70% diameter stenosis, in at
least one major coronary artery, as verified through coronary angiography; 2) left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) <
45%; 3) presence of wall motion abnormalities in at least two contiguous segments, identified by resting echocardio
graphy; and 4) maintenance of sinus rhythm. The study excluded individuals with: 1) prior percutaneous coronary
intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass grafting; 2) unstable angina; 3) recent myocardial infarction (< 6 weeks); 4)
atrial fibrillation; 5) severe valvular disease; 6) comorbid cardiomyopathy; 7) loss to follow-up; and 8) segments poorly
visualized by echocardiography.
In the initial cohort, 55 patients were successfully enrolled and subsequently completed the follow-up phase, with
a total of 273 dyssynergic myocardial segments identified from 880 segments. Revascularization through PCI was
determined independently of the MCE results, adhering to established clinical guidelines.21 For the development and
validation of the ML model, the study population was randomly divided into training and testing cohorts at a 7:3 ratio,
while simultaneously ensuring a comparable proportion of dyssynergic segments between the two cohorts. This resulted
in 39 patients in the training set with 205 dyskinetic segments (representing 32.9%) and 16 patients in the testing set with
68 dyskinetic segments (representing 26.6%), enabling robust model training and unbiased performance evaluation.
Echocardiographic Protocol
Echocardiographic evaluation was conducted using a GE Vivid E95 ultrasound system with an M3S probe (GE
Healthcare, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). Two skilled operators, unaware of the patients’ clinical information, performed
both two-dimensional echocardiography and MCE within one week before the revascularization. A follow-up echocar
diography to assess myocardial recovery was scheduled 6–9 months post-revascularization. Measurements of LVEF were
carried out using the Simpson’s biplane method. Segmental wall motion was evaluated in a standard 16-segment model,
supplemented by speckle-tracking longitudinal strain bull’s eye plot for reference. Each segment was graded on a scale as
follows: 1 for normal motion, 2 for hypokinesis, 3 for akinesis, and 4 for dyskinesis. Dysfunctional myocardial segments
were identified based on initial wall motion scores (WMS) of 2 (hypokinesis) or higher. Functional recovery of these
segments was determined by a decrease of ≥1 grade in the WMS, as observed in follow-up echocardiography compared
to baseline measurements.
MCE Procedure
MCE was executed in conjunction with routine echocardiography before revascularization. The procedure involved
imaging in apical 4-chamber, 2-chamber, and long-axis views, employing a continuous low power setting with
a mechanical index of 0.1. A contrast agent, prepared by mixing 59 mg of SonoVue (Bracco, Imaging B.V.,
Switzerland) with 5 mL saline, was administered intravenously at 2.5 mL with a flow rate of 1 mL/min. Upon achieving
optimal opacification of the ventricular cavity and myocardium, the ultrasound system was switched to the “flash”
impulse (transient high mechanical index impulses) to disrupt the microbubbles within the myocardium. This was
followed by a return to low-power scanning to observe microbubble replenishment. Images captured 15 beats after the
“flash” impulse from each apical view were recorded and later converted into cine-loop format for replenishment curve
analysis. Furthermore, images acquired at end-systolic triggering, 5 beats after the “flash” impulse, were also recorded
from these views for additional radiomics analysis.
Replenishment Curve Fitting
The offline analysis of MCE images was conducted using GE Q-analysis software. As illustrated in Figure 1, the method
involved the placement of sampling points within the dyssynergic segments of the myocardium to track the region of

interest (ROI) dynamically. The replenishment curve was then evaluated based on a predefined perfusion model
represented by the equation yðtÞ 1⁄4 A1⁄21?ekt� þ B. This process facilitated the computation of key parameters crucial
for understanding myocardial perfusion dynamics: the “A” value, representing myocardial blood volume; the “k” value,
indicating myocardial perfusion velocity; and the “B” value, denoting tissue intensity. Subsequently, the product of the
“A” and “k” values was calculated to estimate local myocardial blood flow (MBF).
Image Segmentation Process
For the segmentation process, 3D Slicer software (version 5.0.2) was utilized to delineate the contours of dyssynergic
myocardial segments as ROI, adhering to the standard 16-segment model for reference. This task was executed by two
experienced sonographers who outlined each myocardial segment to ensure consistency and reliability. The segmentation
involved tracing the dyssynergic segments across five consecutive cardiac cycles at the end-systolic phase of MCE
images following the “flash” impulse. Labels from the first to the fifth cycle are illustrated in Figure 2. The software
initially automated the identification of myocardial regions by detecting grayscale differences in pixels. Subsequent
manual refinement was applied to these automated outlines to precisely define the boundaries of the dyssynergic
segments. The finalized contours were saved in the nrrd (Nearly Raw Raster Data) file format, ensuring the accuracy
and reproducibility of the data for further radiomics analysis.
Radiomics Feature Extraction
The extraction of radiomics features was conducted using the Pyradiomics open-source toolkit, transforming segmented
medical images into a high-dimensional, structured format for detailed myocardial perfusion analysis. All images were
standardized through resampling to a uniform resolution of 1×1 mm using nearest-neighbor interpolation. From each
ROI, 1314 distinct features were derived, encompassing 12 shape, 18 first-order statistical, and 75 textural features from
the original images. To further enhance the analysis, we applied six preprocessing filters to the first-order and textural
features, generating an additional 1209 filtered features. These filters were selected to capture various aspects of
myocardial texture and structure. The Exponential Filter was used to enhance higher intensity values, highlighting subtle
variations in high-intensity myocardial regions. The Gradient Filter emphasized edges and boundaries, aiding in the

identification of textural differences. The Logarithm Filter reduced the dynamic range to accentuate subtle variations in
lower-intensity areas. The Square Filter intensified the effect of higher pixel values, while the Square-root Filter
enhanced lower intensity values to differentiate areas of minimal perfusion. Finally, the Wavelet Filter decomposed
the image to capture both spatial and frequency information, providing a comprehensive view of myocardial texture and
structure. All extracted features were collated and organized in an Excel spreadsheet, preparing for the next stage of
feature selection and analytical processing.
Data Preprocessing
Prior to the selection and analysis, all data underwent a comprehensive preprocessing phase to ensure analytical fairness.
This phase included the normalization of both the radiomics features and the clinical data. Continuous variables
underwent Z-score normalization, standardized to a mean of zero and standard deviation of one. Categorical variables
were converted to binary format, marked as “0” or “1”. For the predictive model, clinical outcomes were determined by
functional recovery in dysfunctional myocardial segments. Segments showing ≥1 grade decrease in WMS were classified
as “0” (recovered), while others were classified as “1” (not recovered).
Radiomics Feature Selection
The selection of radiomics features predictive of myocardial following revascularization was conducted through
a structured multi-step approach. Initially, the interobserver reliability was assessed using the intraclass correlation
coefficient (ICC), with a threshold of 0.80 indicating acceptable agreement. To identify potential predictors of myocardial
recovery, we utilized the Wilcoxon rank sum (WRS) test, a non-parametric method suitable for comparing the distribu
tions of radiomics features between myocardial segments that showed recovery and those that did not after revascular
ization. Features with false discovery rate-adjusted P-values below 0.1 were identified as potential predictors of recovery.
Further refinement was achieved using the minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR) algorithm, which
selected the top 10 features per cardiac cycle based on their relevance and minimal redundancy, totaling 50 features
across five cycles. The final selection stage employed least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic
regression to isolate the most predictive features for myocardial recovery post-revascularization. Figure 3 presents the
Figure 2 Sequential MCE images from end-systolic phases following the “flash” impulse across five cardiac cycles. (A–E) represent the first through fifth cycles, respectively. The green segment indicates the mid-anterior dyssynergic myocardial segment, and the yellow segment denotes the apical anterior dyssynergic myocardial segment.

entire workflow of the radiomics feature analysis, illustrating the sequential steps taken to develop and refine our
predictive model.
ML Models Derivation and Testing
To predict the likelihood of recovery failure, four established ML classifiers were deployed: logistic regression (Logit),
random forests (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). Models were developed
using MCE parameters, radiomics features, and a combination of both. The training phase for each data subset involved
10-fold cross-validation and a grid search algorithm to fine-tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting. It allowed for
the division of the training data into interchangeable sets for training and validation, enabling reliable model evaluation
and ensuring high precision and generalizability. The entire process of algorithm selection, cross-validation, and
hyperparameter optimization was conducted using the Scikit-Learn library in Python. For the RF classifier,
a configuration of 500 trees was established, with node splitting based on the square root of the total number of features.
The SVM employed a radial basis function (RBF) kernel, suitable for non-linear data, with the cost parameter and
gamma for the RBF kernel optimized via grid search in the ranges [0.1, 1, 10] and [0.001, 0.01, 0.1], respectively.
XGBoost parameters were set to a learning rate of 0.02, a maximum tree depth of 4, and an ensemble of 600 trees,
determined through grid search to balance complexity and accuracy.
After derivation, each model underwent comprehensive internal validation, assessing discrimination, calibration, and
clinical utility. The relative standard deviation (RSD) of prediction accuracy from 10-fold cross-validation was recorded
to further evaluate model consistency. The optimal model was selected based on superior discrimination, satisfactory
stability, credibility, and clinical applicability. Model performance was further quantified through accuracy, precision,
recall, kappa, and F1 scores derived from the confusion matrix. Moreover, an extensive evaluation of the optimal model
was conducted using a designated testing cohort to further assess its predictive performance.
Figure 3 Workflow for radiomics analysis: segmentation of images, extraction and selection of features. This process includes delineation of dyssynergic myocardial segments in accordance with the 16-segment model across five consecutive cardiac cycles at the end-systolic phase of MCE images, following the “flash” impulse. Three classes of radiomics features (shape, first-order, texture) were extracted per ROI, augmented with additional first-order and textural features through six filters. A four-step selection protocol (inter-observer consistency, WRS test, mRMR algorithm, and LASSO regression) was employed to identify primary indicators of myocardial recovery.

Statistical Analysis
Statistical assessments were conducted employing methodologies congruent with the data typology. Continuous variables
following a normal distribution were evaluated using independent samples t-tests, and chi-square tests were utilized for
the analysis of categorical variables. Skewed continuous variables and ordinal data were examined using the WRS test.
Model discrimination was quantified by the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, commonly
known as the AUC. Calibration of each model was assessed through calibration curve analysis alongside the Brier score.
Decision curve analysis (DCA) was employed to determine the clinical utility by quantifying net benefits across various
threshold probabilities. Execution of these statistical processes was carried out using IBM SPSS Statistics (v 22.0, SPSS
Inc.) and Python (v 3.7.1).
Result
Patient Cohort Characteristics
Figure 4 presents the criteria and process for patient selection, along with the derivation and validation of the predictive
model in this study, which included 55 patients with chronic CAD. Of these, 44 were males with an average age of 63.27
± 7.61 years. All participants successfully completed the prescribed echocardiographic protocol and underwent success
ful revascularization without any adverse events. Post-revascularization follow-up indicated wall motion improvements
in 139 segments (50.9%, 139/273). The observed rates of wall motion improvement between the training and testing sets
were 50.7% and 51.5%, respectively, with no statistically significant difference (P-value = 0.916). Table 1 further
illustrates that the baseline characteristics of the patients and myocardial segments were balanced across both datasets,
showing no significant differences (all P-values > 0.05).
MCE and Myocardial Recovery Prediction
MCE was employed to predict myocardial recovery in 205 dyskinetic segments from a training set, where 104 segments
showed recovery and 101 exhibited no improvement in wall motion. The efficacy of MCE parameters, namely A, k, and
MBF, in predicting functional recovery was assessed through ROC curve analysis. Figure 5 demonstrates that MBF
achieved the most notable AUC at 0.770 (95% CI: 0.706 to 0.826), indicating its superior performance for myocardial
recovery. When a preoperative MBF threshold of ≤1 dB2/s was applied, the sensitivity for predicting the recovery six
months following revascularization was determined to be 70.30%, with a specificity of 74.04%. Additionally, the positive
predictive value and negative predictive value of MBF was 72.45% and 71.97%, respectively. MBF was then normalized
using the Z-score method and incorporated into ML models to enhance the prognostication of functional recovery in
dyskinetic myocardial segments.
Radiomics Analysis
In the radiomics analysis of this study, 6570 features were extracted from dyssynergic myocardial segments across five
successive cardiac cycles at the end-systolic phase post-“flash” using MCE images, contributing 1314 distinct features
per cycle. Following normalization, the inter-observer reliability assessment revealed that, on average, 65%, 68%, 73%,
75%, and 70% of features from the first to fifth cardiac cycles, respectively, achieved an ICC of 0.80 or higher. The WRS
test further refined this dataset, yielding 122, 107, 126, 120, and 123 features for the respective cycles, correlated with
segmental function recovery. Further refinement through the mRMR algorithm isolated the top 10 features from each
cycle, based on relevance and minimal redundancy, leading to a final set of 50 features per segment. The concluding
feature selection stage, utilizing LASSO logistic regression, identified nine radiomics features significantly correlated
with segmental function recovery, comprising four from the second cardiac cycle, three from the third, and two from the
fourth. The LASSO selection process is depicted in Figure 6. Detailed descriptions and weights of the selected radiomics
features are provided in Supplemental Table S1. Figure 7 presents a heatmap of the nine identified features, demonstrat
ing minimal inter-feature correlation. The highest correlation coefficient among these features does not exceed 0.3,
suggesting low collinearity and emphasizing the unique contribution of each feature to the prediction of functional
recovery in myocardial segments.

to three distinct data sets: normalized MBF values, nine selected radiomic features, and a combined dataset integrating
both elements.
Table 2 compares the efficacy of each model, while Figure 8A–I depict the performance of models utilizing MBF
data, radiomics features, and the combined dataset, respectively. For models trained on MBF data, Logit and SVM
exhibited superior performance in discrimination (AUC: 0.780–0.782) and excelled across various confusion matrix
indicators. However, according to the DCA analysis, their utility was restricted to a threshold probability range of 30%
70%. In contrast, the RF model, trained specifically on radiomics features, exhibited the highest discriminative capability
(AUC: 0.858), outperforming MBF-based models in terms of discrimination, accuracy, precision, kappa, BSD, and F1
score. Notably, its DCA curve demonstrated a consistent net benefit across the entire 0–100% threshold probability range.
Further investigation of models utilizing the combined dataset highlighted the enhanced discriminative ability of the RF
classifier (AUC: 0.901) and improved accuracy and kappa values, although with a minor reduction in calibration.
Remarkably, this model achieved a precision of 1.000, significantly reinforcing confidence in future decision-making
for CAD management based on predictive outcomes. The DCA curve for the combined dataset model also substantiated
its comprehensive net benefit across the entire 0–100% threshold probability range. In light of these findings, the RF
classifier, employing a combination of MBF values and radiomics features, is identified as the optimal model for
predicting segmental function recovery in CAD patients.

Validation of the Optimal Model with the Testing Set
The efficacy of the RF model in predicting myocardial recovery was validated using the testing dataset. This model analyzed
MBF and radiomics data to estimate the likelihood of functional non-improvement in dyskinetic segments. These predictions
were compared with actual outcomes of wall motion improvement, employing ROC, calibration, and DCA curves, as
depicted in Figure 9. Despite a minor decrease in performance compared to the training dataset, the RF model retained
significant discriminative power, evidenced by an AUC of 0.821. The calibration curve indicated high concordance between
predicted probabilities and observed events, especially when predictions exceeded a 30% probability threshold. DCA further
validated the model’s clinical utility, showing notable net benefits for thresholds above 30%. These findings established the
RF model as a valuable tool for myocardial recovery prediction after revascularization.
Discussion
In this preliminary study, an integration of ML techniques with radiomics derived from MCE images is introduced for
predicting functional recovery in myocardial segments after revascularization. This innovative method stands out by
extracting and analyzing radiomics features from dyssynergic segments, captured across five successive cardiac cycles at
the end-systolic phase subsequent to the “flash” impulse in MCE. Employing ML algorithms, particularly the RF
classifier, enables effective interpretation of these intricate and possibly non-linear features. The study identifies nine
critical radiomics features, in conjunction with MBF values from MCE, as crucial predictors. The RF model, integrating
these elements, demonstrates superior predictive capability compared to traditional MCE replenishment curve analysis.
This refined approach presents a non-invasive, accurate method for preoperative evaluation of viable myocardium,
offering significant potential to enhance clinical decision-making and overall management of chronic CAD.

In myocardial recovery following revascularization, the balance between viable hypocontractile and fibrotic tissues in
dysfunctional segments is crucial.22 MCE is recognized for its precision in evaluating regional functional recovery,23,24
yet it relies heavily on visual interpretation. Even with advanced software for replenishment curve analysis in dyssy
nergic segments, the critical placement of the ROI is still predominantly manual, introducing potential inaccuracies. In
this study, an AUC of 0.770 for MBF in predicting segmental recovery suggested limitations in predictive reliability.
Utilizing a diagnostic threshold of ≤1 dB2/s, the observed positive and negative predictive values indicated that
approximately 30% of myocardial segments might exhibit outcomes contrary to MBF predictions. This discrepancy
could be attributed to the distribution of viable myocardium across myocardial layers.25 Significant subendocardial
fibrosis, despite normal MBF in the epicardial and mid-myocardial layers, might impede functional recovery after
revascularization.26 Additionally, energy distribution within the acoustic field could lead to unexpected functional
recovery in low MBF areas.8 Radiomics, however, addresses these visual limitations by extracting comprehensive data
from dyssynergic segments in MCE images, thus eliminating issues related to ROI placement and subjective observation
of myocardial perfusion.27,28 By leveraging comprehensive data analysis, radiomics offers a more objective and thorough
approach, potential enhancing the accuracy of myocardial viability assessment and functional recovery prediction after
revascularization.
In this study, a high mechanical index pulse was applied to instantaneously obliterate myocardial microbubbles within
the myocardium during MCE. The ensuing five cardiac cycles following this disruption, specifically in the systolic phase,
were targeted for radiomics analysis. This specific selection is critical as it captures the replenishment phase of
microbubbles into the myocardial tissue. Focusing on these initial cycles is essential for observing the myocardium in
its reperfusion state, which assists in differentiating perfusion conditions across different myocardial segments.29
Additionally, the emphasis on end-systolic images is crucial because during systole, the myocardium thickens and
the minute intramyocardial vessels collapse, predominantly leaving the capillaries as the main contributors to the
microbubble signal.30 Analyzing images from this specific phase effectively minimizes interference from intramyocardial
vessel signals, thus allowing for a more accurate extraction of radiomics features indicative of myocardial perfusion and
viability.
Our investigation entailed an extensive extraction of features, resulting in 6570 radiomics features from each
dyssynergic myocardial segment across a training set comprising 205 segments. This process required managing
approximately 1.34 million data points, creating a highly dimensional multi-omics dataset. Such complexity extends

beyond the analytical scope of traditional linear models like Logit, which typically struggle with high-dimensional and
intricate data interactions. Thus, ML techniques were employed, offering a methodologically superior approach to
manage this complexity.31,32 Through detailed feature selection, our analysis streamlined these features into nine key
radiomics attributes, significantly correlated with myocardial recovery. Integrated with MBF values, these features
formed the basis of our predictive models. Among the evaluated ML models, the RF model was identified as the most
effective, demonstrating high accuracy even in the testing dataset. The effectiveness of the RF model stems from its
capability to efficiently manage large datasets and its robustness against overfitting, adeptly handling non-linearities and
interactions among features, thus making it highly suitable for complex datasets.33
Notably, the critical radiomics features for predicting myocardial recovery were predominantly sourced from
the second to fourth cardiac cycles, which more distinctly reveal perfusion differences in the myocardium compared
to the first and fifth cycles. These features, which include two first-order and seven textural types, intricately quantify
intensity uniformity, variability, and outliers in myocardial tissue. Such nuanced characteristics are challenging to discern

The analyses, encompassing ROC, calibration, and DCA curves, indicate a notable predictive accuracy of models using the combined dataset.

through conventional visual inspection, necessitating advanced computational techniques for their extraction.
Sophisticated preprocessing methods, including multiple filters, were crucial in identifying these features and their
association with myocardial recovery.
To our knowledge, this study is the first to explore myocardial perfusion imaging parameters from MCE using
a radiomics-based ML approach to enhance the prediction accuracy of myocardial recovery after coronary revascular
ization. The ML-based model developed in this study surpassed previous studies that utilized traditional myocardial
perfusion imaging methods such as single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), speckle tracking echocar
diography, and MCE, which reported AUCs ranging from 0.7 to 0.8 for myocardial function recovery prediction.8,11,34,35
This demonstrates the substantial potential of the MCE radiomics-based ML model in identifying visually subtle yet
highly predictive image features. Although a few reports exist on radiomics-based ML approaches in myocardial function
prediction,19 including the findings of Arian et al36 which showed that MRI radiomics features combined with ML

algorithms provided prognostic information regarding myocardial function in patients after coronary artery bypass
grafting with an AUC similar to our report at 0.78, this study represents the first application of a radiomics-based ML
approach in MCE. Furthermore, the integration of MBF into the model further enhanced predictive accuracy. This
highlights the significance of merging radiomics features with clinical parameters, affirming that while radiomics is
promising in predictive analysis, the inclusion of clinical data is essential for more comprehensive and accurate
predictions.
In this initial exploration of combining radiomics and ML in MCE for myocardial recovery prediction after
revascularization, the results are indeed promising but not without limitations. Constrained by its single-center design
and a limited cohort size, the study’s applicability across broader populations is uncertain. Moreover, the absence of post
revascularization coronary angiography to exclude restenosis might compromise the accuracy of our findings.
Inconsistencies in MCE protocols across various institutions could also impact the reproducibility and efficacy of the
proposed radiomics-based ML models. Additionally, the follow-up period, limited to 6–9 months, may not be sufficient
to capture delayed myocardial recovery, particularly as some HM may take over a year to recover.37 Lastly, while the
proposed ML model demonstrates impressive performance within this study, its robustness needs external validation in
diverse clinical settings. To overcome these limitations, future research should be directed towards multi-center studies
with larger sample sizes and extended follow-up durations. Such studies would help validate and refine these models,
deepening our understanding of myocardial recovery mechanisms and improving therapeutic strategies for chronic CAD.
In summary, this study has effectively demonstrated the efficacy of the RF model, which integrates radiomics features
from MCE and MBF values, for predicting the functional recovery of dyskinetic myocardial segments in chronic CAD
patients undergoing revascularization. The incorporation of a radiomics-based ML approach signifies a significant
advancement in precision medicine, offering a more nuanced and data-driven method for prognostic evaluation. This
enhanced accuracy and predictive capability of our RF model facilitate a more customized approach in CAD manage
ment, potentially improving individualized therapeutic strategies.
