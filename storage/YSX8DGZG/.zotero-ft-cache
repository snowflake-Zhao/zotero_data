Updates in Version 1.2022 of the NCCN Guidelines for Breast Cancer from Version 8.2021 include:

BINV-D • Page heading modified: Considerations for Surgical Axillary Staging • Top pathway, sentinel lymph node mapping and excision, and
sentinel lymph node positive Added pathways for "breast-conserving surgery" versus
"mastectomy." Added option for consideration of no further axillary surgery for
those who meet all of the following criteria after mastectomy: ◊ cT1–T2, cN0 ◊ No preoperative chemotherapy ◊ 1–2 positive SLNs ◊ Adjuvant RT planned with intentional inclusion of undissected
axilla at risk Modified option after BCS or mastectomy: Micrometastases seen
in SLN post-mastectomy • Bottom pathway, changed "US-guided FNA or core biopsy +/- clip
placement" to "US-guided FNA or core biopsy + clip placement recommended." • Footnote e added: Limited data exist for mastectomy patients. • Footnote g added: ACOSOG Z0011: Giuliano AE, et al. JAMA. 2017 Sep 12;318(10):918-926. • Footnote h added: EORTC AMAROS: Donker M, et al. Lancet Oncol. 2014;15(12):1303-10; Rutgers E, et al. Cancer Research. 2019;79(4 Supplement):GS4-01-GS04-01. • Footnote i added: Limited data exist for ≥3 positive SLN. • Footnote k modified: In the mastectomy setting, in patients who were initially cN0, who have positive nodes on SLNB, and have no axillary dissection, RT to the chest wall should include chest wall, supraclavicular ± internal mammary nodes, and full axilla undissected axilla at risk ± RNI. • Footnote removed: For patients with clinically negative axilla who are undergoing mastectomy and for whom RT is planned, axillary radiation may replace axillary dissection level I/II for regional control of disease.

BINV-H (5 of 7) • Second bullet added: Some patients may choose not to have
reconstruction after mastectomy. The option to undergo mastectomy alone with a surgically optimized closure should be offered to all patients as part of a comprehensive discussion of reconstructive options. Achieving the optimal result in this scenario may require additional procedures beyond the initial mastectomy. See BINV-H (6 of 7) for patient factors influencing choice of reconstruction. BINV-H (7 of 7) • Nipple-Sparing Mastectomy, line modified: Nipple margin assessment (ideally intraoperatively) is mandatory, and the nipple margin should be clearly designated. BINV-I (1 of 3) • Whole Breast Radiation First bullet modified: Target definition is the breast tissue at risk in
entirety. Bullet added: Ultra-hypofractionated WBRT of 28.5 Gy delivered
as 5 (once-a-week) fractions may be considered in select patients aged >50 years following BCS with pTis/T1/T2/N0, though the optimal fractionation for the boost delivery is unknown for this regimen. Bullets removed: ◊ For patients who require a more limited number of treatment
visits for WBRT delivery, ultra-hypofractionated WBRT of 28.5 Gy delivered as 5 (once-a-week) fractions, may be considered in selected patients aged ≥50 years following BCS with pTis/T1/T2/ N0 tumors. However, late toxicity effects beyond 10 years are not currently defined. ◊ The optimal fractionation for the delivery of a boost is not known for this regimen. • Footnote a added: Alternatively, 26 Gy in 5 daily fractions over one week may be considered, though data beyond 5 years for local relapse or toxicity are not yet available for this regimen. (Murray Brunt A, Haviland JS, Wheatley DA, et al. Hypofractionated breast radiotherapy for 1 week versus 3 weeks (FAST-Forward): 5-year efficacy and late normal tissue effects results from a multicentre, non-inferiority, randomised, phase 3 trial.

category 1, preferred regimen. Second-line option modified: Ado-trastuzumab emtansine (TDM-1) has
been changed from a category 1, preferred regimen to a category 2A, other recommended regimen. Heading modified: Third line and beyond (optimal sequence is not known.) • Footnote j modified: Regimens may also be used as an option for thirdline and beyond or fourth-line option; the optimal sequence for third-line therapy and beyond is not known. • Footnote l added: Fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki may be considered in the first-line setting as an option for select patients (ie, those with rapid progression within 6 months of neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy [12 months for pertuzumab-containing regimens]). • Footnote n modified: Tucatinib + trastuzumab + capecitabine is preferred in patients with both systemic and CNS progression in the third line setting and beyond; on ado-trastuzumab emtansine. However, tucatinib + trastuzumab + capecitabine and it may be given in the second-line setting. • Footnote removed: Fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki is preferred in patients with visceral metastases if progression on ado-trastuzumab emtansine. BINV-Q (5 of 8) • Trastuzumab + docetaxel, second bullet modified: Docetaxel 35 mg/m2 IV days 1, 8, and 15 weekly cycled every 28 days BINV-Q (6 of 8) • Trastuzumab + lapatinib, first bullet modified: Lapatinib 1000 mg PO daily for 21 days BINV-R (1 of 3) • TNBC, biomarker modified: PD-L1 expression (using 22C3 antibody) BINV-S (3 of 3) • Bone scan, frequency modified for those receiving endocrine therapy to: Every 2–6 months. PHYLL-1 • After excisional biopsy, moved benign phyllodes tumor to separate pathway, recommending clinical follow-up for 3 y.

IBC-1 • Footnote removed: The accurate assessment of in-breast
tumor or regional lymph node response to preoperative systemic therapy is difficult, and should include physical examination and performance of imaging studies (mammogram and/or breast MRI) that were abnormal at the time of initial tumor staging. Selection of imaging methods prior to surgery should be determined by the multidisciplinary team. IBC-2 • Heading added for clarification: Response to Preoperative Therapy • Added to "no response" pathway: Patients may be candidates for multiple lines of systemic therapy to palliate advanced breast cancer. At each reassessment clinicians should assess value of ongoing treatment, the risks and benefits of an additional line of systemic therapy, patient performance status, and patient preferences through a shared decisionmaking process. ST-5 • Replaced Histologic Types (previously listed on ST-4) with the following: Histopathologic Type- WHO Classification 5th Edition (2019) WHO Classification of Tumors Editorial Board, ed. WHO

c See Principles of Dedicated Breast MRI Testing (BINV-B). d The use of MRI has not been shown to increase likelihood of negative margins or
decrease conversion to mastectomy. Data to support improved long-term outcomes are lacking. e Re-resection(s) may be performed in an effort to obtain negative margins in patients desiring breast-conservation therapy. Patients in whom adequate surgical margins cannot be achieved with BCS should undergo a total mastectomy. For definition of adequate surgical margins, see Margin Status Recommendations After BCS for Invasive Cancers and DCIS (BINV-F). f Complete axillary lymph node dissection should not be performed in the absence of evidence of invasive cancer or proven axillary metastatic disease in patients with apparent pure DCIS. However, a small proportion of patients with apparent pure DCIS will be found to have invasive cancer at the time of their definitive surgical procedure. Therefore, the performance of a sentinel lymph node (SLN) procedure should be considered if the patient with apparent pure DCIS is to be treated with mastectomy or with excision in an anatomic location compromising the performance of a future SLN procedure.

g See Principles of Radiation Therapy (BINV-I). h Patients found to have invasive disease at total mastectomy or re-excision
should be managed as having clinical stage l or stage ll disease (See ST1), including lymph node staging. i See Special Considerations to Breast-Conservation Therapy Requiring Radiation Therapy (BINV-G). j WBRT following BCS reduces ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence rates in DCIS by about 50%–70%. Approximately half of the recurrences are invasive and half are DCIS. A number of factors determine local recurrence risk: palpable mass, larger size, higher grade, close or involved margins, and age <50 years. If the patient and physician view the individual risk as “low,” some patients may be treated by excision alone, particularly if they are ER-positive and will be receiving endocrine therapy. Select patients with low-risk DCIS may be considered suitable for APBI if they meet all aspects of the definition of low-risk DCIS from the RTOG 9804 trial, including screen-detected DCIS, low to intermediate nuclear grade, tumor size ≤2.5 cm, and surgical resection with margins negative at >3 mm. k See Principles of Breast Reconstruction Following Surgery (BINV-H).

Note: All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated. Clinical Trials: NCCN believes that the best management of any patient with cancer is in a clinical trial. Participation in clinical trials is especially encouraged.

NCCN Guidelines Index Table of Contents Discussion

Risk reduction therapy for ipsilateral breast following breastconserving surgery (BCS): • Consider endocrine therapy for 5 years for patients with ER-
positive DCIS, if: Treated with BCS and RTm (category 1), especially for
patients with ER-positive DCIS. Treated with excision alonel • Endocrine therapy: Tamoxifenm,n for premenopausal patients Tamoxifenm,n or aromatase inhibitor for postmenopausal
patients with some advantage for aromatase inhibitor therapy in patients <60 years or with concerns for thromboembolism Risk reduction therapy for contralateral breast: • Counseling regarding risk reduction

• Interval history and physical exam every 6–12 mo for 5 y, then annually
• Mammogram every 12 mo (first mammogram 6–12 mo, after breast-conservation therapy, category 2B)

l Available data suggest endocrine therapy provides risk reduction in the ipsilateral breast treated with breast conservation and in the contralateral breast in patients with mastectomy or breast conservation with ER-positive primary tumors. Since a survival advantage has not been demonstrated, individual consideration of risks and benefits is important.
m CYP2D6 genotype testing is not recommended for patients considering tamoxifen. n The standard dose of tamoxifen is 20 mg/day for 5 years. Low-dose tamoxifen (5 mg/day for 3 years) is an option only if patient is symptomatic on the 20-mg dose or if
patient is unwilling or unable to take standard-dose tamoxifen.

Note: All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated. Clinical Trials: NCCN believes that the best management of any patient with cancer is in a clinical trial. Participation in clinical trials is especially encouraged.

cc T he prognosis of patients with T1a and T1b tumors that are node negative is uncertain even when HER2 is amplified or overexpressed. This is a population of breast cancer patients that was not studied in the available randomized trials. The decision for use of trastuzumab therapy in this cohort of patients must balance the known toxicities of trastuzumab, such as cardiac toxicity, and the uncertain, absolute benefits that may exist with trastuzumab therapy.
dd Adjuvant chemotherapy with weekly paclitaxel and trastuzumab can be considered for pT1,N0,M0, HER2-positive cancers, particularly if the primary cancer is HRnegative. The absolute benefit of HER2-based systemic chemotherapy is likely negligible in patients with hormone receptor-positive cancers and tumor size bordering on T1mic (<1 mm), when the estimated recurrence risk is less than 5% and endocrine therapy remains a viable option for systemic treatment.

Screening for metastases: • In the absence of clinical signs and symptoms suggestive of recurrent disease, there is no indication for laboratory or imaging studies for metastases screening.

Endocrine therapy: • Assess and encourage adherence to adjuvant endocrine
therapy • Patients on tamoxifen: Age-appropriate gynecologic screening Routine annual pelvic ultrasound is not recommended • Patients on an aromatase inhibitor or who experience
ovarian failure secondary to treatment should have monitoring of bone health with a bone mineral density determination at baseline and periodically thereafterccc Lifestyle: • Evidence suggests that active lifestyle, healthy diet, limited alcohol intake, and achieving and maintaining an ideal body weight (20–25 BMI) may lead to optimal breast cancer outcomes Communication: • Coordination of care between the primary care provider and specialists is encouraged. Additionally, a personalized survivorship treatment plan including personalized treatment summary of possible long-term toxicity and clear follow-up recommendations is recommended. See NCCN Guidelines for Survivorship Engagement: • Patients frequently require follow-up encouragement in order to improve adherence to ongoing screening and medication adherence

See Recurrent Disease (BINV-18)

bbb Studies indicate that annual mammograms are the appropriate frequency for surveillance of breast cancer patients who have had BCS and RT with no clear advantage to shorter interval imaging. Patients should wait 6 to 12 months after the completion of RT to begin their annual mammogram surveillance. Suspicious findings on physical examination or surveillance imaging might warrant a shorter interval between mammograms.
ccc T he use of estrogen, progesterone, or selective estrogen receptor modulators to treat osteoporosis or osteopenia in patients with breast cancer is discouraged. The use of a bisphosphonate (oral/IV) or denosumab is acceptable to maintain or to improve bone mineral density and reduce risk of fractures in postmenopausal (natural or induced) patients receiving adjuvant aromatase inhibitor therapy. Optimal duration of either therapy has not been established. Duration beyond 3 years is not known. Factors to consider for duration of anti-osteoporosis therapy include bone mineral density, response to therapy, and risk factors for continued bone loss or fracture. There are case reports of spontaneous fractures after denosumab discontinuation. Patients treated with a bisphosphonate or denosumab should undergo a dental examination with preventive dentistry prior to the initiation of therapy, and should take supplemental calcium and vitamin D.

Note: All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated. Clinical Trials: NCCN believes that the best management of any patient with cancer is in a clinical trial. Participation in clinical trials is especially encouraged.

PET/CT is performed and clearly indicates bone metastasis, on both the PET and CT component. tt FDG PET/CT can be performed at the same time as diagnostic CT. FDG PET/CT is most helpful in situations where standard staging studies are equivocal or suspicious. FDG PET/CT may also be helpful in identifying unsuspected regional nodal disease and/or distant metastases when used in addition to standard staging studies.

ddd False-negative ER and/or PR determinations occur, and there may be discordance between the ER and/or PR determination between the primary and metastatic tumor(s). Therefore, endocrine therapy with its low attendant toxicity may be considered in patients with non-visceral or asymptomatic visceral tumors, especially in patients with clinical characteristics predicting for a HR-positive tumor (eg, long disease-free interval, limited sites of recurrence, indolent disease, older age).
eee In clinical situations where a biopsy cannot safely be obtained but the clinical evidence is strongly supportive of recurrence, treatment may commence based on the ER/PR/HER2 status of the primary tumor. Since ER/PR and HER2 status can change with treatment and metastatic progression, it may be appropriate to consider repeat testing on new samples in these scenarios if management will change.

and eligible for endocrine therapies, there are more limited data on the subgroup of cancers with ER-low–positive (1%–10%) results. The ER-low–positive group is heterogeneous with reported biologic behavior often similar to ER-negative cancers; thus, individualized consideration of risks and benefits of endocrine therapy and additional adjuvant therapies should be incorporated into decision-making. See Principles of Biomarker Testing (BINV-A). mmm Routine surgical resection of the primary breast tumor is generally not indicated in the management of patients presenting with de novo stage IV (M1) disease. Although there is no survival benefit, it may be considered for local control of the primary tumor. Discussion regarding management of the primary tumor in this setting must be individualized.

nnn Denosumab, zoledronic acid, or pamidronate (all with calcium and vitamin D supplementation) should be given (category 1) in addition to chemotherapy or endocrine therapy if bone metastasis is present, expected survival is ≥3 months, and renal function is adequate. Patients should undergo a dental examination with preventive dentistry prior to initiation of this therapy. The optimal schedule for zoledronic acid is every 12 weeks.

b Laboratory must participate in a quality assurance accreditation program for HER2 testing. Otherwise, tissue specimen should be sent to an accredited laboratory for testing. Health care systems and providers must cooperate to ensure the highest quality testing.
c Evidence from trastuzumab adjuvant trials show that HER2 testing by ISH or IHC have similar utility to predict clinical benefit from HER2-targeted therapy.

d Single-probe ISH assays are not preferentially recommended but if used, cases with average HER2 copy number ≥4.0 and <6.0 signals/cell should base final results on concurrent IHC and if 2+ reflexed to dual probe ISH testing.
e For ISH Groups 2–4 final ISH results are based on review of concurrent IHC, with recounting of the ISH test by a second reviewer if IHC is 2+ (per 2018 CAP/ASCO Update recommendations). Additional report comments are recommended for negative final results in these ISH Groups.

• Laboratories should have standard operating procedures to maximize accuracy and reproducibility of results for cases with <10% ER staining or weak intensity staining (to avoid false negatives). The status of controls should be reported for cases with these results.

• ER testing should be used to determine if a patient is a candidate for endocrine therapies. Cancers with 1%–100% of cells positive for ER expression are considered ER-positive. Patients with these results are considered eligible for endocrine therapies (applies to DCIS and invasive cancers). Invasive cancers with between 1%–10% ER positivity are considered ER-low–positive. There are more limited data on the benefit of endocrine therapies in this group, but they suggest possible benefit from endocrine treatment, so patients are considered eligible for this treatment (as above). However, this group is noted to be heterogeneous and the biologic behavior of ER-low–positive cancers may be more similar to ER-negative cancers. This should be considered in decisionmaking for other adjuvant therapy and overall treatment pathway.

• PR testing by IHC on invasive cancers can aid in the prognostic classification of cancers and serve as a control for possible falsenegative ER results. Patients with ER-negative, PR-positive cancers may be considered for endocrine therapies, but the data on this group are noted to be limited. The same overall interpretation principles apply but PR should be interpreted as either positive (if 1%–100% of cells have nuclear staining) or negative (if <1% or 0% of cells have nuclear staining).
• Interpretation of any ER result by pathology should include evaluation of the concordance with the histologic findings of each case. Clinicians should be aware of when results are unusual and work with pathologists to attempt to resolve (eg, repeat testing, consultative review) or explain atypical reported findings. See table below.

Cancers with <1% staining are considered ER-negative. Patients with cancers with these results have not been shown to benefit from endocrine therapies. Summary of ER IHC Scoring/Interpretation

PRINCIPLES OF DEDICATED BREAST MRI TESTING

See NCCN Guidelines for Breast Cancer Screening and Diagnosis for indications for screening MRI in patients at increased breast cancer risk.

Personnel, Facility, and Equipment • Breast MRI examinations are performed with IV contrast and should
be performed and interpreted by an expert breast imaging team working in concert with the multidisciplinary treatment team. • Breast MRI examinations require a dedicated breast coil and breast imaging radiologists familiar with the optimal timing sequences and other technical details for image interpretation. The imaging center should have the ability to perform MRI-guided needle sampling and/ or image-guided localization of MRI-detected findings.

Clinical Indications and Applications • May be used for staging evaluation to define extent of cancer or
presence of multifocal or multicentric cancer in the ipsilateral breast, or as screening of the contralateral breast cancer at time of initial diagnosis (category 2B). There are no high-level data to demonstrate that the use of MRI to facilitate local therapy decisionmaking improves local recurrence or survival.1 • May be helpful for breast cancer evaluation before and after preoperative systemic therapy to define extent of disease, response to treatment, and potential for breast-conservation therapy. • May be useful in identifying otherwise clinically occult disease in patients presenting with axillary nodal metastases (cT0, cN+), with Paget disease, or with invasive lobular carcinoma poorly (or inadequately) defined on mammography, ultrasound, or physical examination. • False-positive findings on breast MRI are common. Surgical decisions should not be based solely on the MRI findings. Additional tissue sampling of areas of concern identified by breast MRI is recommended. • The utility of MRI in follow-up screening of patients with prior breast cancer is undefined. It should generally be considered only in those whose lifetime risk of a second primary breast cancer is >20% based on models largely dependent on family history, such as in those with the risk associated with inherited susceptibility to breast cancer.

FERTILITY AND BIRTH CONTROL See NCCN Guidelines for Adolescent and Young Adult (AYA) Oncology

• All premenopausal patients should be informed about the potential impact of chemotherapy on fertility and asked about their desire for potential future pregnancies. Patients who may desire future pregnancies should be referred to fertility specialists before chemotherapy and/or endocrine therapy to discuss the options based on patient specifics, disease stage, and biology (which determine the urgency, type, and sequence of treatment). Timing and duration allowed for fertility preservation, options inclusive of oocyte and embryo cryopreservation as well as evolving technologies, and the probability of successful pregnancies subsequent to completion of breast cancer therapy are also to be discussed.
• Although amenorrhea frequently occurs during or after chemotherapy, it appears that the majority of patients younger than 35 years resume menses within 2 years of finishing adjuvant chemotherapy.
• Menses and fertility are not necessarily linked. Absence of regular menses, particularly if the patient is taking tamoxifen, does not necessarily imply infertility. Conversely, the presence of menses does not guarantee fertility. There are limited data regarding continued fertility after chemotherapy.
• Patients should not become pregnant during treatment with RT, chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, or during or within 6 months of completing trastuzumab or pertuzumab.

• Although data are limited, hormone-based birth control is discouraged regardless of the HR status of the patient's cancer.
• Alternative methods of birth control include intrauterine devices (IUDs), barrier methods, or, for patients with no intent of future pregnancies, tubal ligation or vasectomy for the partner.
• Randomized trials have shown that ovarian suppression with GnRH agonist therapy administered during adjuvant chemotherapy in premenopausal patients with breast tumors (regardless of HR status) may preserve ovarian function and diminish the likelihood of chemotherapy-induced amenorrhea.
• Smaller historical experiences in patients with ER-positive disease have reported conflicting results with regard to the protective effect of GnRH agonist therapy on fertility.
• Breastfeeding following breast-conservation cancer treatment is not contraindicated. However, the quantity and quality of breast milk produced by the conserved breast may not be sufficient or may be lacking some of the nutrients needed. Breastfeeding is not recommended during active treatment with chemotherapy and endocrine therapy or within 6 months of completing trastuzumab or pertuzumab.

AXILLARY LYMPH NODE STAGING SLNB should be performed and is the preferred method of axillary lymph node staging if the patient is an appropriate SLNB candidate (See BINV-D). In the absence of definitive data demonstrating superior survival, the performance of axillary staging may be considered optional in patients who have particularly favorable tumors, patients for whom the selection of adjuvant systemic and/or RT is unlikely to be affected, the elderly, or those with serious comorbid conditions. Level III dissection to the thoracic inlet should be performed only in cases with gross disease in level II and/or lll. In the absence of gross disease in level II nodes, lymph node dissection should include tissue inferior to the axillary vein from the latissimus dorsi muscle laterally to the medial border of the pectoralis minor muscle (level I/II). Lymphedema is a potential side effect after the treatment of axillary lymph node surgery resulting from damage to the lymphatic system. Early detection/diagnosis of lymphedema is key for optimal management. Consider pretreatment measurement of both arms as a baseline for patients with risk factors for lymphedema. See NCCN Guidelines for Survivorship: Lymphedema (SLYMPH-1).

NCCN Guidelines Index Table of Contents Discussion

MARGIN STATUS RECOMMENDATIONS AFTER BREAST-CONSERVING SURGERY (BCS) FOR INVASIVE CANCERS AND DCIS • Margins should be evaluated on all surgical specimens from breast-conserving surgery (BCS). Requirements for optimal margin evaluation
include: Orientation of the surgical specimens Description of the gross and microscopic margin status Reporting of the distance, orientation, and type of tumor (invasive or DCIS) in relation to the closest margin. • For mammographically detected DCIS with microcalcifications, complete resection should be documented by analysis of margins and specimen radiography. Post-excision mammography can be considered if there is uncertainty. • The NCCN Panel accepts the definitions of negative margins after breast-conservation therapy from the 2014 SSO/ASTRO Margins Guideline1 for Stage I/II Invasive Cancers and the 2016 SSO/ASTRO/ASCO Guideline for DCIS.2 For patients with stage I or II invasive cancers after BCS, a positive margin is defined as “ink on tumor” (any invasive cancer or DCIS cells on ink). These patients generally require further surgery—either a re-excision to achieve a negative margin or a mastectomy. If re-excision is technically feasible to allow for BCS to achieve “no ink on tumor,” this can be done with resection of the involved margin guided by the orientation of the initial resection specimen or reexcision of the entire original excision cavity. There may be select patients with stage III invasive cancers who may be eligible for BCS. For these patients, the margins status would be accessed with similar definitions. DCIS • For patients with pure DCIS treated by BCS and WBRT, a quantitative description of any tumor close to margin resection width of at least 2 mm is associated with a reduced risk of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) relative to narrower negative margin widths, while the routine practice of obtaining margins greater than 2 mm to further improve outcomes is not supported by the evidence. When there is only minimal or focal DCIS involvement near the margin, clinical judgment should be utilized to weigh the risks of re-excision with risk of recurrence for an individual patient. • For patients with DCIS treated with excision alone (no WBRT), regardless of margin width, there is a substantially higher rate of IBTR than treatment with excision and WBRT, even in predefined, low-risk patients. Although the optimal margin width for treatment with excision alone is unknown, it should be at least 2 mm, with some evidence suggesting improved IBTR rates with margin widths wider than 2 mm. • DCIS with microinvasion (DCIS-M), defined as an invasive focus ≤1 mm in size, should refer to the DCIS margin definition when considering the optimal margin width (>2 mm), given that the majority of DCIS-M is comprised of DCIS and systemic therapy utilization for this lesion more closely reflects the treatment pattern for DCIS than for invasive carcinoma.

MARGIN STATUS RECOMMENDATIONS AFTER BCS FOR INVASIVE CANCERS AND DCIS Invasive Breast Cancer • For invasive breast cancers that have a component of DCIS, regardless of the extent of DCIS, the negative margin definition of “no ink on
tumor” should be based on the invasive margin guideline. In this setting, “no ink on tumor” is recommended for either DCIS or invasive cancer cells, primarily because the natural history, treatment, and outcomes of these lesions are more similar to invasive cancer than DCIS. For specifically challenging cases, clinical judgment and discussion with the patient should precede routine re-excision. • These margin recommendations cannot be applied directly to patients undergoing APBI,1 where data regarding local recurrence are more limited. Furthermore, individualized clinical judgment should be utilized on a case-by-case basis, using postoperative mammography to identify residual calcifications and clinical-pathologic factors such as quantitative extent of disease near margin, presence of extensive intraductal component (EIC),3 young age, or multiple close margins to assist in identifying patients who may have an increased risk of IBTR and therefore may be selected to benefit from re-excision. • For patients with invasive breast cancer after BCS, with microscopically focally positive margins (in the absence of an EIC),3 the use of a higher radiation boost dose to the tumor bed may be considered, since generally a boost to the tumor bed is recommended for patients at higher risk of recurrence.

a See General Principles of Breast Reconstruction (BINV-H 5 of 7). b See Patient Factors Affecting Choice of Reconstruction (BINV-H 6 of 7). c An evaluation of the likely cosmetic outcome of BCS should be performed prior to surgery.
Oncoplastic techniques for breast conservation can extend breast-conserving surgical options in situations where the resection by itself would likely yield an unacceptable cosmetic outcome. Application of these oncoplastic techniques may reduce the need for mastectomy and decrease the need for a secondary surgery to minimize breast deformity. Patients should be informed of the possibility of positive margins and potential need for secondary surgery, which could include either segmental re-excision, or mastectomy with or without loss of the nipple. Systematic oncoplastic reduction specimen orientation as well as highly specific operative documentation regarding tissue rearrangement should be conducted. Enhanced communication between the radiation oncology team and reconstructive team will be necessary for boost cavity localization for RT treatment planning (Shah C, et al. Ann Surg Oncol 2018;25:2509-2511).

d Consider staged partial mastectomy reconstruction (oncoplastic approaches) if preoperative margin status is unclear (lobular, multifocal/centric).
e As with any mastectomy, there is a risk of locoregional cancer recurrence, and evidence suggests skin-sparing or skin- and nipple-sparing mastectomy is probably equivalent to standard mastectomy in this regard. Post-mastectomy RT should still be applied in cases treated by skin-sparing mastectomy following the same selection criteria as for standard mastectomy.

Healing issues may occur and delay initiation of RT.

i Consider delaying autologous reconstruction until after RT is completed, as RT to a flap may cause loss of cosmesis and/or fat necrosis.
j Consultation with radiation oncology may be necessary to determine if volume of contralateral tissue expander will affect RT treatment plan, because cases may require contralateral deflation. Radiation oncology consultation should also be requested in cases of an anticipated close or positive deep margin, as this may impact the optimal placement of the expander (pre- vs. subpectoral).
k Exchange of tissue expander to implant should be timed to avoid any delay in adjuvant RT.

PRINCIPLES OF BREAST RECONSTRUCTION FOLLOWING SURGERY
General Principles of Breast Reconstruction • Breast reconstruction may be an option for any patient receiving surgical treatment for breast cancer. All patients undergoing breast
cancer treatment should be educated about breast reconstructive options as adapted to their individual clinical situation. However, breast reconstruction should not interfere with the appropriate surgical management of the cancer or the scope of appropriate surgical treatment for this disease. Coordinating consultation and surgical treatment with a reconstructive surgeon should be executed within a reasonable time frame. The process of breast reconstruction should not govern the timing or the scope of appropriate surgical treatment for this disease. The availability of or the practicality of breast reconstruction should not result in the delay or refusal of appropriate surgical intervention. • Some patients may choose not to have reconstruction after mastectomy. The option to undergo mastectomy alone with a surgically optimized closure should be offered to all patients as part of a comprehensive discussion of reconstructive options. Achieving the optimal result in this scenario may require additional procedures beyond the initial mastectomy. See BINV-H (6 of 7) for patient factors influencing choice of reconstruction. • Selection of reconstruction option is based on an assessment of cancer treatment, patient body habits, obesity, smoking history, comorbidities, and patient concerns. Smoking and obesity (WHO Class 2 and 3) increase the risk of preoperative complications for all types of breast reconstruction, whether with implant or flap prosthetic or autologous. Patients with these risk factors should be counseled about their increased risk for complications following breast reconstruction, including donor site complications/hernias and bulges of the abdominal wall, delayed healing, mastectomy skin flap necrosis, total flap failure (obesity), and implant failure (smoking). • Nipple areolar reconstruction should be offered to patients if the nipple-areolar complex (NAC) has been removed as part of their cancer treatment. Various techniques are available for nipple reconstruction. Three-dimensional (3-D) tattooing can be offered to patients as an option for NAC reconstruction. • Additionally, patients who are not satisfied with the cosmetic outcome following completion of breast cancer treatment should be offered reconstructive surgery consultation. • Patients known to harbor genetic mutations that increase the risk of breast cancer may opt to undergo bilateral prophylactic mastectomies with reconstruction. Reconstruction can be performed with prosthetic, autologous tissue, or a combination of implant with autologous tissue. • Skin-sparing mastectomy should be performed by an experienced breast surgery team that works in a coordinated, multidisciplinary fashion to guide proper patient selection for skin-sparing mastectomy, determine optimal sequencing of the reconstructive procedure(s) in relation to adjuvant therapies, and perform a resection that achieves appropriate surgical margins. • Revisional surgery may be necessary after breast reconstruction. This may include procedures such as fat grafting, mastopexy, direct excision/suction-assisted lipectomy, contralateral procedures (in cases of unilateral reconstruction), and others. Patients should be informed before reconstruction that revision surgery may be necessary.

Note: All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated. Clinical Trials: NCCN believes that the best management of any patient with cancer is in a clinical trial. Participation in clinical trials is especially encouraged.

PRINCIPLES OF BREAST RECONSTRUCTION FOLLOWING SURGERY
Patient Factors Influencing Breast Reconstruction • Breast reconstruction is elective and patients may choose to not have breast reconstruction. Individual patients present preoperatively with
a variety of factors that may impact the choice of reconstruction, the risk of complications, donor site morbidity, and aesthetic result. Each of these factors must be taken into account, along with patient desire, to choose the optimal method of reconstruction. • Patient desire The patient may have a strong feeling towards one form of reconstruction after being given the options. Breast reconstruction should be a
shared decision. • Medical comorbidities Medical comorbidities may preclude longer reconstructive procedures such as autologous tissue reconstruction in some patients. The selection of the reconstructive method of choice should take into consideration patient comorbidities. Poorly controlled diabetes is a risk factor for postoperative complications in both implant and autologous tissue reconstruction. Patients should be screened for personal or familial thrombophilia. Thrombophilia may result in reconstructive failure of microsurgical
reconstruction or thromboembolic events. • Tobacco use Smoking has been associated with increased risk of delayed wound healing, mastectomy flap necrosis, NAC necrosis in the setting of
nipple-sparing mastectomy, infection, and failure of implant-based reconstruction. In free flap reconstruction, smoking increases the risk of donor complications. Patients should be encouraged to stop smoking prior to reconstruction. Smoking has not definitively been shown to increase the risk of microvascular thrombosis in free flap breast reconstruction. • Breast size/shape If patient has significant macromastia or ptosis, consideration can be given to a reduction pattern mastectomy with either implant-based or autologous tissue reconstruction, or oncoplastic reduction techniques. The volume limitations of implants may preclude an acceptable reconstruction in patients with macromastia if preservation of volume is a priority. • BMI Patients with a markedly elevated BMI may be at increased risk of infectious complications and seromas as well as donor site complications from autologous reconstruction, including delayed healing and hernia formation. Immediate reconstruction can be performed, but delayed reconstruction can be considered if the patient is motivated to lose weight. Oncoplastic reduction techniques can be considered if the breast is large/ptotic. • Breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma (BIA-ALCL) There exists an association between certain types of textured breast implants and BIA-ALCL. The risk appears to vary based on the method of texturing. Patients with a past or current history of textured implants should follow up with their reconstructive surgeon. See NCCN Guidelines for T-Cell Lymphomas.

Note: All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated. Clinical Trials: NCCN believes that the best management of any patient with cancer is in a clinical trial. Participation in clinical trials is especially encouraged.

PRINCIPLES OF BREAST RECONSTRUCTION FOLLOWING SURGERY

Special Cases • Nipple-sparing mastectomy Historically, the NAC has been sacrificed with skin-sparing mastectomy for cancer therapy. However, NAC-sparing procedures may be an
option in cancer patients who are carefully selected by experienced multidisciplinary teams. Retrospective data support the use of NACsparing procedures for early-stage breast cancer, DCIS, risk-reduction procedures, and in some locally advanced invasive cancers (ie, with complete clinical response to preoperative chemotherapy and no nipple involvement with cancer). Preoperative clinical or radiographic evidence of nipple involvement, including Paget disease, bloody nipple discharge associated with malignancy, IBC, and/or imaging findings suggesting malignant involvement of the nipple or subareolar tissues contraindicates nipple preservation. Nipple margin assessment is mandatory, and the nipple margin should be clearly designated. Preoperative breast size, shape, and nipple position should also be considered in the decision to perform NAC-sparing mastectomy. Patients with small to moderate breast volume with good nipple position are ideal candidates. In patients with large or significantly ptotic breasts, NAC-sparing mastectomies may be offered in select cases by using various reduction patterns or delay techniques to augment the NAC perfusion, either in an immediate or delayed fashion, as long as it does not delay oncologic care. Intraoperative assessment of the NAC perfusion should also guide the decision to preserve the NAC or remove it. Patients should be counseled on the risk of delayed healing, nipple necrosis, loss of pigmentation, loss of sensation, loss of projection, and need for subsequent removal of the NAC. • Inflammatory breast cancer Delayed reconstruction after mastectomy for IBC remains the clinical standard, for several reasons. The need to resect involved skin negates the benefit of skin-sparing mastectomy for immediate reconstruction, and high rates of local and distant recurrence warrant comprehensive, regional nodal irradiation in a timely fashion, which may be technically more challenging or subject to delay after immediate reconstruction. Advances in multimodal therapy have improved 5-year survival in IBC patients, justifying clinical studies to see if immediate reconstruction may be appropriate for certain patients with IBC, but neither the outcomes nor the clinical features to predict such outcomes are known at this time. In the uncommon clinical circumstance that the extent of skin excision at the time of mastectomy precludes primary or local closure, reconstruction of the chest wall defect with autologous tissue is necessary, and concomitant immediate reconstruction may be accomplished.

Note: All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated. Clinical Trials: NCCN believes that the best management of any patient with cancer is in a clinical trial. Participation in clinical trials is especially encouraged.

PRINCIPLES OF RADIATION THERAPY Optimizing Delivery of Individual Therapy • It is important to individualize RT planning and delivery. 3-D CT-based treatment planning should be routinely utilized to delineate target volumes and adjacent organs at risk. Radiation to the breast/chest wall and nodal regions is generally delivered with single energy or mixed energy photons ± electrons. Improved homogeneity of the target dose and sparing of normal tissues can be accomplished using compensators such as wedges,
forward planning using segments, and intensity-modulated RT (IMRT). Additional techniques such as respiratory control (deep inspiration breath-hold), prone positioning, and cardiac blocks may also be used
to try to further reduce dose to heart, lung, and adjacent normal tissue. Verification of treatment setup consistency is done with weekly imaging. When using certain techniques (ie, prone breast), more frequent
imaging may be appropriate. Standard utilization of daily imaging is not recommended. When treating the internal mammary nodes, dose-volume histograms (DVHs) should be used to evaluate dose constraints, dose to normal
tissues (ie, heart, lung), and planning target volumes (PTVs). • It is common for RT to follow chemotherapy when chemotherapy is indicated. Whole Breast Radiation • Target definition is the breast tissue at risk. • RT dosing: The whole breast should receive a hypofractionated dose of 40–42.5 Gy in 15–16 fractions; in selected cases 45–50.4 Gy in 25–28 fractions
may be considered. A boost to the tumor bed is recommended in patients at higher risk for recurrence. Typical boost doses are 10–16 Gy in 4–8 fractions. • Lumpectomy cavity boost can be delivered using enface electrons, photons, or brachytherapy. • Ultra-hypofractionated WBRT of 28.5 Gy delivered as 5 (once-a-week) fractions may be considered in select patients aged >50 years following BCS with pTis/T1/T2/N0, though the optimal fractionation for the boost delivery is unknown for this regimen.a,b • 3-D planning to minimize inhomogeneity and exposure to heart and lung is essential when using this regimen.

a Alternatively, 26 Gy in 5 daily fractions over one week may be considered, though data beyond 5 years for local relapse or toxicity are not yet available for this regimen.

PRINCIPLES OF RADIATION THERAPY Chest Wall Radiation (including breast reconstruction) • The target includes the ipsilateral chest wall, mastectomy scar, and drain sites when indicated. Depending on whether or not the patient has had breast reconstruction, several techniques using photons and/or electrons are
appropriate. Special consideration should be given to the use of bolus material to ensure that the skin dose is adequate, particularly in the case of IBC. RT dosing:
◊ Dose is 45–50.4 Gy in 25–28 fractions to the chest wall ± scar boost, at 1.8–2 Gy per fraction, to a total dose of approximately 60–66 Gy. • Chest wall scar boost may be delivered with or without bolus using electrons or photons. Regional Nodal Radiation • For paraclavicular and axillary nodes, prescription depth varies based on the patient anatomy. • Regional nodes should be contoured when considering regional nodal RT. Refer to breast atlases for contouring guidelines.c,d • RT dosing: Dose is 45–50.4 Gy in 25–28 fractions to the regional nodal fields. A supplemental boost of RT can be delivered to grossly involved or enlarged lymph nodes (ie, internal mammary or clavicular) that have
not been surgically addressed. RT with Preoperative or Adjuvant Systemic Therapy • In patients treated with preoperative systemic therapy, adjuvant RT is based on the maximal disease stage (ie, clinical stage, pathologic
stage, tumor characteristics) at diagnosis (before preoperative systemic therapy) and pathology results after preoperative systemic therapy. • Sequencing of RT with systemic therapy:
◊ It is common for RT to follow chemotherapy when chemotherapy is indicated. However, – CMF (cyclophosphamide/methotrexate/fluorouracil) and RT may be given concurrently, or CMF may be given first. – Capecitabine should be given after completion of RT. – Olaparib should be given after completion of RT.
◊ Available data suggest that sequential or concurrent endocrine therapy with RT is acceptable. Due to compounding side effects, initiating endocrine therapy at the completion of RT may be preferred.
◊ Adjuvant HER2-targeted therapy ± endocrine therapy may be delivered concurrently with RT.

PRINCIPLES OF RADIATION THERAPY
Accelerated Partial Breast Irradiation (APBI) • Studies of APBI suggest that rates of local control in selected low-risk patients with early-stage breast cancer are comparable to those
treated with standard WBRT. However, compared to standard WBRT, several studies document an inferior cosmetic outcome with external beam delivery methods of APBI. Follow-up is limited and studies are ongoing. Patients are encouraged to participate in clinical trials. The NCCN Panel recommends APBI for any patient who is BRCA negative and meets the 2016 ASTRO criteria.
The 2016 ASTRO criteria defines patients age ≥50 years to be considered "suitable" for APBI if: ◊ Invasive ductal carcinoma measuring ≤2 cm (pT1 disease) with negative margin widths of ≥2 mm, no LVI, and ER-positive
or ◊ Low/intermediate nuclear grade, screening-detected DCIS measuring size ≤2.5 cm with negative margin widths of ≥3 mm. • RT dosing:

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR BREAST CANCER IN MALES (SEX ASSIGNED AT BIRTH)

NCCN recommendations have been developed to be inclusive of individuals of all sexual and gender identities to the greatest extent possible. On this page, the terms males and females refer to sex assigned at birth. • Few males have been included in breast cancer trials.1 Therefore, recommendations regarding management of breast cancer in males are
generally extrapolated from findings of clinical trials focusing on breast cancer in females.

•

Although there are some biologic and clinical differences between breast cancer in males and males is similar overall to management of breast cancer in females, with the following special

females, management of considerations pertinent

tboremaasltecpaantcieenr tisn:2

Genetics: The NCCN Panel recommends consideration of genetic testing for all males with breast cancer (See NCCN Guidelines for Genetic/Familial High-Risk Assessment: Breast, Ovarian, and Pancreatic).

Breast surgery: Historically, males with breast cancer have undergone mastectomy more often than breast-conserving surgery. However, breast-conservation therapy is increasingly being performed in males and evolving data indicate that breast conservation in males is associated with equivalent outcomes to mastectomy and that it is safe and feasible. Decisions about breast conservation versus mastectomy in males should be made according to similar criteria as for females.2-9

Axillary lymph node surgery: As in females, SLNB should be performed in the setting of male breast cancer with a clinically node-negative axilla.2,4
RT: Indications for radiation after breast surgery in males with breast cancer are the same as for females with breast cancer.2,5,10,11

See Additional Considerations for Those Receiving Preoperative/Adjuvant Therapy (BINV-L, 3 of 9)

a Alternative taxanes (ie, docetaxel, paclitaxel, albumin-bound paclitaxel) may be substituted for select patients due to medical necessity (ie, hypersensitivity reaction). If substituted for weekly paclitaxel or docetaxel, then the weekly dose of albumin-bound paclitaxel should not exceed 125 mg/m2.
b The regimens listed in the table for HER2-negative disease are all category 1 (except where indicated) when used in the adjuvant setting.
c It is acceptable to change the administration sequence to taxane (with or without HER2targeted therapy) followed by AC.
d C onsider addition of adjuvant olaparib for 1 y for those with germline BRCA1/2 mutations and: • TNBC, if 1) ≥pT2 or ≥pN1 disease after adjuvant chemotherapy, or 2) residual disease after preoperative chemotherapy • HR-positive, HER2-negative tumors, if 1) ≥4 positive lymph nodes after adjuvant chemotherapy (category 2A), or 2) residual disease after preoperative therapy and a clinical stage, pathologic stage, estrogen receptor status, and tumor grade (CPS+EG) score ≥3 (category 2A). Adjuvant olaparib can be used concurrently with endocrine therapy.

e Patients in the OlympiA trial did not receive capecitabine; thus, there are no data on sequencing or to guide selection of one agent over the other.
f High-risk criteria include stage II–III TNBC. The use of adjuvant pembrolizumab (category 2A) may be individualized.
g The inclusion of platinum agents as neoadjuvant chemotherapy for TNBC remains controversial. Several studies have shown improved pCR rates with incorporation of platinum. However, long-term outcomes remain unknown. The routine use of platinum agents as part of neoadjuvant therapy for TNBC is not recommended for most patients (including BRCA mutation carriers), but it may be considered in select patients (such as those for whom achieving better local control is necessary). The use of platinum agents in the adjuvant setting is not recommended. If platinum agents are included in an anthracyclinebased regimen, the optimal sequence of chemotherapy and choice of taxane agent is not established.

Note: All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated. Clinical Trials: NCCN believes that the best management of any patient with cancer is in a clinical trial. Participation in clinical trials is especially encouraged.

PREOPERATIVE/ADJUVANT THERAPY REGIMENS
Additional Considerations for Those Receiving Preoperative/Adjuvant Therapy • Consider scalp cooling to reduce incidence of chemotherapy-induced alopecia for patients receiving neoadjuvant/adjuvant chemotherapy.
Results may be less effective with anthracycline-containing regimens. • Sequence of therapies in the adjuvant setting: Chemotherapy and endocrine therapy should be given sequentially, with endocrine therapy given after chemotherapy. Adjuvant olaparib can be given concurrently with endocrine therapy. For sequencing of RT with systemic therapy, see BINV-I (2 of 3).
• Considerations for HER2-positive disease: An FDA-approved biosimilar is an appropriate substitute for trastuzumab. Trastuzumab and hyaluronidase-oysk injection for subcutaneous use may be substituted for trastuzumab. It has different dosage and
administration instructions compared to intravenous trastuzumab. Do not substitute trastuzumab and hyaluronidase-oysk for or with adotrastuzumab emtansine. Pertuzumab, trastuzumab, and hyaluronidase-zzxf injection for subcutaneous use may be substituted anywhere that the combination of intravenous pertuzumab and intravenous trastuzumab are given as part of systemic therapy. Pertuzumab, trastuzumab, and hyaluronidase-zzxf injection for subcutaneous use has different dosing and administration instructions compared to the intravenous products.

The selection, dosing, and administration of anti-cancer agents and the management of associated toxicities are complex. Modifications of drug dose and schedule and initiation of supportive care interventions are often necessary because of expected toxicities and individual patient variability, prior treatment, and comorbidity. The optimal delivery of anti-cancer agents therefore requires a health care delivery team experienced in the use of anti-cancer agents and the management of associated toxicities in patients with cancer.

The selection, dosing, and administration of anti-cancer agents and the management of associated toxicities are complex. Modifications of drug dose and schedule and initiation of supportive care interventions are often necessary because of expected toxicities and individual patient variability, prior treatment, and comorbidity. The optimal delivery of anti-cancer agents therefore requires a health care delivery team experienced in the use of anti-cancer agents and the management of associated toxicities in patients with cancer.

PRINCIPLES OF PREOPERATIVE SYSTEMIC THERAPY

Known Benefits of Preoperative Systemic Therapy • Facilitates breast conservation • Can render inoperable tumors operable • Treatment response provides important prognostic information at an
individual patient level, particularly in patients with TNBC or HER2positive breast cancer • Identifies patients with residual disease at higher risk for relapse to allow for the addition of supplemental adjuvant regimens, particularly in patients with TNBC or HER2-positive breast cancer. • Allows time for genetic testing • Allows time to plan breast reconstruction in patients electing mastectomy • Allows time for delayed decision-making for definitive surgery Opportunities • May allow SLNB alone if initial cN+ becomes cN0 after preoperative therapy • May provide an opportunity to modify systemic treatment if no preoperative therapy response or progression of disease • May allow for more limited radiation fields in patients with cN+ who become cN0/pN0 after preoperative therapy • Provides excellent research platform to test novel therapies and predictive biomarkers

Cautions • Possible overtreatment with systemic therapy if clinical stage is
overestimated • Possible undertreatment locoregionally with radiotherapy if
clinical stage is underestimated • Possibility of disease progression during preoperative systemic
therapy Candidates for Preoperative Systemic Therapy • Patients with inoperable breast cancer: IBC Bulky or matted cN2 axillary nodes cN3 nodal disease cT4 tumors • In select patients with operable breast cancer Preoperative systemic therapy is preferred for:
◊ HER2-positive disease and TNBC, if ≥cT2 or ≥cN1 ◊ Large primary tumor relative to breast size in a patient who
desires breast conservation ◊ cN+ disease likely to become cN0 with preoperative systemic
therapy Preoperative systemic therapy can be considered for cT1c, cN0
HER2-positive disease and TNBC • Patients in whom definitive surgery may be delayed.

Non-candidates for Preoperative Systemic Therapy • Patients with extensive in situ disease when extent of invasive
carcinoma is not well-defined • Patients with a poorly delineated extent of tumor • Patients whose tumors are not palpable or clinically assessable

Note: All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated. Clinical Trials: NCCN believes that the best management of any patient with cancer is in a clinical trial. Participation in clinical trials is especially encouraged.

NCCN Guidelines Version 4.2022 Invasive Breast Cancer

NCCN Guidelines Index Table of Contents Discussion

PRINCIPLES OF PREOPERATIVE SYSTEMIC THERAPY
• Randomized trials of chemotherapy demonstrate similar long-term outcomes when patients are given the same treatment preoperatively compared with postoperatively.a
• Pathologic complete response (pCR) to preoperative systemic therapy is associated with an extremely favorable disease-free and overall survival, particularly in situations in which all treatment is given preoperatively. The correlation between pathologic response and long-term outcome is strongest for TNBC, somewhat less so for HER2-positive disease, and least for ER-positive disease.b,c
• A number of chemotherapy regimens have activity in the preoperative setting. In general, those chemotherapy regimens recommended in the adjuvant setting may be considered in the preoperative setting. See Preoperative/Adjuvant Therapy Regimens (BINV-L).
• Preoperative endocrine therapy alone may be considered for patients with ER-positive disease based on comorbidities or low-risk luminal biology based on clinical characteristics and/or genomic signatures.
• Patients with HER2-positive tumors should be treated with preoperative systemic therapy incorporating trastuzumab.d A pertuzumabcontaining regimen may be administered preoperatively to patients with ≥ pT2 or ≥ pN1, HER2-positive early-stage breast cancer. See Preoperative/Adjuvant Therapy Regimens (BINV-L).
• Some studies suggest an increased risk of locoregional recurrence following use of preoperative chemotherapy.e These trials delivered chemotherapy regimens that are no longer standard, did not include targeted therapies, did not use modern imaging techniques, and/or used non-standard locoregional management. Care should be taken to follow the procedures outlined in BINV-12 and BINV-14 to assure appropriate locoregional management. Not all patients are appropriate candidates for preoperative systemic therapy. Accurate clinical staging at baseline prior to initiation of preoperative systemic therapy is critical. See Potentially Operable Disease: Breast and Axillary Evaluation Prior to Preoperative Systemic Therapy (BINV-12).
• Tumor response should be routinely assessed by clinical exam and imaging studies (see footnote uu on BINV-13) during delivery of preoperative therapy. It is preferred that the standard regimen is completed prior to surgery. If all intended treatment is not completed prior to surgery, the remainder may be given in the adjuvant setting. Patients with operable breast cancer experiencing progression of disease during preoperative systemic therapy may be given an alternate systemic regimen or proceed to surgery if deemed resectable. Locoregional therapy principles should be applied in the same manner as in patients treated with adjuvant systemic therapy.

Patients with T1b/c–2, pN0, HR-positive, HER2-negative tumors, with risk scores (RS) between 0–10 have a risk of distant recurrence of <4% and those with RS 11–25 derived no benefit from the addition of chemotherapy to endocrine therapy in the prospective TAILORx study.1 Postmenopausal patients with pT1–3, pN1, HR-positive, HER2-negative, with RS <26 derived no benefit from the addition of chemotherapy to endocrine therapy in the prospective RxPONDER study.2
In postmenopausal patients with pT1–3, HR-positive, HER2-negative, and pN0 and pN1 (1–3 positive nodes) tumors and an RS ≥26, the addition of chemotherapy to endocrine therapy is recommended.1,2
Premenopausal patients with T1b/c –2, pN0, HR-positive, HER2-negative tumors with RS <16 derived no benefit from the addition of chemotherapy to endocrine therapy in the prospective TAILORx study.1 In premenopausal patients with RS between 16–25, a small benefit from the addition of chemotherapy could not be ruled out, but it is unclear if the benefit was due to the ovarian suppression effect promoted by chemotherapy in premenopausal patients.1,2 For this group, consider chemotherapy followed by endocrine therapy or alternatively, ovarian function suppression combined with either tamoxifen or an AI. In premenopausal patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative, and pN0 tumors and an RS ≥26, the addition of chemotherapy to endocrine therapy is recommended.1 In premenopausal patients with pT1–3 and pN1 (1–3 positive nodes) tumors and an RS <26, the addition of chemotherapy to endocrine therapy was associated with a lower rate of distant recurrence compared with endocrine monotherapy2 but it is unclear if the benefit was due to the ovarian suppression effects promoted by chemotherapy. For this group of patients, consider chemotherapy followed by endocrine therapy or alternatively, ovarian function suppression combined with either tamoxifen or an AI.2

Patients with high clinical risk and low genomic risk were randomly assigned to receive chemotherapy (n = 749) or not (n = 748); this was the intention-to-treat population. The 8-year estimates for distant metastasisfree survival in the intention-to-treat population were 92.0% (95% CI, 89.6–93.8) for chemotherapy versus 89.4% (86.8–91.5) for no chemotherapy (HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.48–0.92). An exploratory analysis confined to the subset of patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative disease (1358 [90.7%] of 1497 randomly assigned patients, of whom 676 received chemotherapy and 682 did not) shows different effects of chemotherapy administration on 8-year distant metastasis-free survival according to age: 93.6% (95% CI, 89.3–96.3) with chemotherapy versus 88.6% (83.5–92.3) without chemotherapy in 464 patients aged 50 years or younger (absolute difference 5.0 percentage points [SE, 2.8; 95% CI, −0.5–10.4]) and 90.2% (86.8–92.7) versus 90.0% (86.6–92.6) in 894 females older than 50 years (absolute difference 0.2 percentage points [2.1, −4.0– 4.4]). The 8-year distant metastasis-free survival in the exploratory analysis by nodal status in these patients was 91.7% (95% CI, 88.1–94.3) with chemotherapy and 89.2% (85.2–92.2) without chemotherapy in 699 node-negative patients (absolute difference 2.5 percentage points [SE, 2.3; 95% CI, −2.1 –7.2]) and 91.2% (87.2–94.0) versus 89.9% (85.8–92.8) for 658 patients with one to three positive nodes (absolute difference 1.3 percentage points [2.4, −3.5–6.1]).3

Node negative:

Low (0–40),

For patients with T1 and T2 HR-positive, HER2-negative, pN0 tumors, a risk of recurrence score in the low

Intermediate (41–60), range, regardless of T size, places the tumor into the same prognostic category as T1a–T1b,N0,M0.4

High (61–100)

Node positive: Low (0–40)
Node positive: High (41–100)

In patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative, pN+ tumors (1–3 positive lymph nodes) with low risk of recurrence score, treated with endocrine therapy alone, the distant recurrence risk was less than 3.5% at 10 years and no distant recurrence was seen at 10 years in the TransATAC study in a similar group.5

Low (≤3.3) High (>3.3)

For patients with T1 and T2 HR-positive, HER2-negative, and pN0 tumors, a 12-gene low-risk score, regardless of T size, places the tumor into the same prognostic category as T1a–T1b,N0,M0.6 In ABCSG 6/8, patients in the low-risk group had risk of distant recurrence of 4% at 10 years and in the TransATAC study, patients with 1–3 positive nodes in the low-risk group had a 5.6% risk of distant recurrence at 10 years.6,7 The assay is prognostic in endocrine and chemo-endocrine treated patients.7

a Gene expression assays provide prognostic and therapy-predictive information that complements T,N,M and biomarker information. Use of these assays is not required

for staging. The 21-gene assay (Oncotype Dx) is preferred by the NCCN Breast Cancer Panel for prognosis and prediction of chemotherapy benefit. Other prognostic

gene expression assays can provide prognostic information but the ability to predict chemotherapy benefit is unknown. b See Special Considerations for Breast Cancer in Males (Sex Assigned at Birth) (BINV-J).

Recurrence Risk/ Predictive Result
BCI (H/I) Low
BCI (H/I) High

Treatment Implications
• For patients with T1 and T2 HR-positive, HER2-negative, and pN0 tumors, a BCI (H/I) in the low-risk range (0–5), regardless of T size, places the tumor into the same prognostic category as T1a–T1b, N0,M0.
• Patients with BCI (H/I) low demonstrated a lower risk of distant recurrence (compared to BCI [H/I] high) and no significant improvement in DFS or OS compared to the control arm in terms of extending endocrine therapy duration.8
• For patients with T1 HR-positive, HER2-negative, and pN0 tumors, a BCI (H/I) high (5.1–10) demonstrated significant rates of late distant recurrence.
• In secondary analyses of the MA.17, Trans-aTTom, and IDEAL trials, patients with HR-positive, T1–T3, pN0 or pN+ who had a BCI (H/I) high demonstrated significant improvements in DFS when adjuvant endocrine therapy was extended, compared to the control arm.8-11
• In contrast, BCI (H/I) low patients derived no benefit from extended adjuvant therapy.8

a Gene expression assays provide prognostic and therapy-predictive information that complements T,N,M and biomarker information. Use of these assays is not required

NCCN Guidelines Version 4.2022 Invasive Breast Cancer

NCCN Guidelines Index Table of Contents Discussion

DEFINITION OF MENOPAUSE • Menopause is the permanent cessation of menses and includes a profound and permanent decrease in ovarian estrogen synthesis. • Determination of menopausal status may be required to guide selection of endocrine therapy for breast cancer. • Menopause is usually a clinical diagnosis made after ≥12 months of amenorrhea. Natural menopause is experienced between ages 42–58
years. • Breast cancer treatments may affect ovarian function and menses. In those who are pre-menopausal at the beginning of chemotherapy and who develop chemotherapy-induced amenorrhea, ovarian function
may still be intact despite amenorrhea or may resume over time. The likelihood of ovarian function resuming after chemotherapy is higher among those aged <40 years. Tamoxifen may cause amenorrhea without inducing menopause in pre-menopausal individuals. Ovarian function suppression induces amenorrhea and reduces ovarian estrogen synthesis without causing permanent menopause. • Twelve months of amenorrhea alone is insufficient to diagnose menopause with chemotherapy-induced amenorrhea or with tamoxifen ± ovarian suppression. Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and estradiol levels are used to support the diagnosis of menopause; however, clear criteria to guide interpretation of FSH and estradiol in this population is lacking. Tamoxifen may alter FSH levels, limiting its utility in determination of menopausal status. FSH and estradiol should be repeated serially to ensure menopausal status in breast cancer patients with chemotherapy-induced amenorrhea. • Evidence-based criteria for the diagnosis of menopause in patients with breast cancer are lacking. Clinical trials in breast cancer have utilized a variety of definitions of menopause. Reasonable criteria for determining menopause in patients with breast cancer include any of the following: Prior bilateral oophorectomy Age ≥60 years Age <60 with amenorrhea for ≥12 months in the absence of prior chemotherapy, receipt of tamoxifen, toremifene, or ovarian suppression and estradiol and FSH in the post-menopausal range Age <60 years: chemotherapy-induced amenorrhea for ≥12 months with FSH and estradiol in post-menopausal range on serial assessments Age <60 years: on tamoxifen with FSH and estradiol level in post-menopausal range • Menopausal status cannot be determined in those receiving ovarian function suppression

Note: All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated. Clinical Trials: NCCN believes that the best management of any patient with cancer is in a clinical trial. Participation in clinical trials is especially encouraged.

SYSTEMIC THERAPY FOR ER- AND/OR PR-POSITIVE RECURRENT UNRESECTABLE (LOCAL OR REGIONAL) OR STAGE IV (M1) DISEASEa

HER2-Negative and Postmenopausal or Premenopausal Receiving Ovarian Ablation or Suppression

Preferred Regimens First-Line Therapy • Aromatase inhibitor + CDK4/6 inhibitor (abemaciclib,
palbociclib, or ribociclib) (category 1)b • Selective ER down-regulator (fulvestrant, category 1)c
+ non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor (anastrozole, letrozole) (category 1)c • Fulvestrant + CDK4/6 inhibitor (abemaciclib, palbociclib, or ribociclib) (category 1)b
Preferred Regimens Second- and Subsequent-Line Therapy • Fulvestrant + CDK4/6 inhibitor (abemaciclib,
palbociclib, or ribociclib) if CKD4/6 inhibitor not previously used (category 1)d,e • For PIK3CA-mutated tumors, see additional targeted therapy options (see BINV-R)e,f • Everolimus + endocrine therapy (exemestane, fulvestrant, tamoxifen)e,g

Other Recommended Regimens First- and Subsequent-Line Therapy • Selective ER down-regulator Fulvestrantc • Non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor Anastrozole Letrozole • Selective estrogen receptors modulator Tamoxifen • Steroidal aromatase inactivator
Exemestane
Useful in Certain Circumstancesf Subsequent-Line Therapy • Megestrol acetate • Estradiol • Abemaciclibe,h

HER2-Positive and Postmenopausali,j,k or Premenopausal Receiving Ovarian
Ablation or Suppression
• Aromatase inhibitor ± trastuzumab • Aromatase inhibitor ± lapatinib • Aromatase inhibitor ± lapatinib + trastuzumab • Fulvestrant ± trastuzumab • Tamoxifen ± trastuzumab

a Baseline assessment of bone density recommended for patients receiving an aromatase inhibitor who are at risk of osteoporosis (eg, age >65, family history, chronic steroids).
b In phase 3 randomized controlled trials, ribociclib + endocrine therapy has shown overall survival benefit in the first-line setting.
c A single study (S0226) in patients with HR-positive breast cancer and no prior chemotherapy, biological therapy, or endocrine therapy for metastatic disease demonstrated that the addition of fulvestrant to anastrozole resulted in prolongation of time to progression and overall survival. Subset analysis suggested that patients without prior adjuvant tamoxifen and more than 10 years since diagnosis experienced the greatest benefit. Two studies with similar design (FACT and SOFEA) demonstrated no advantage in time to progression with the addition of fulvestrant to anastrozole.
d In phase 3 randomized controlled trials, fulvestrant in combination with a CDK4/6 inhibitor (abemaciclib, palbociclib, and ribociclib) has shown overall survival benefit in the second-line setting.
e If there is disease progression while on a CDK4/6 inhibitor, there are limited data to support the use of another CKD4/6 inhibitor. If there is progression while on a PI3K inhibitor, there are limited data to support another line of therapy with a PIK3CA-containing regimen. If there is disease progression while on an everolimus-containing regimen, there are no data to support an additional line of therapy with another everolimus regimen.

f See Additional Targeted Therapies and Associated Biomarker Testing for Recurrent or Stage IV (M1) Disease (BINV-R).
g A combination of exemestane with everolimus can be considered for patients who meet the eligibility criteria for BOLERO-2 (progressed within 12 mo or on non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor).
h Indicated after progression on prior endocrine therapy and prior chemotherapy in the metastatic setting.
i An FDA-approved biosimilar is an appropriate substitute for trastuzumab.
j Trastuzumab and hyaluronidase-oysk injection for subcutaneous use may be substituted for trastuzumab. It has different dosage and administration instructions compared to intravenous trastuzumab. Do not substitute trastuzumab and hyaluronidase-oysk for or with ado-trastuzumab emtansine or fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki.
k If treatment was initiated with chemotherapy and trastuzumab + pertuzumab, and the chemotherapy was stopped, endocrine therapy may be added to trastuzumab + pertuzumab.

Note: All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated. Clinical Trials: NCCN believes that the best management of any patient with cancer is in a clinical trial. Participation in clinical trials is especially encouraged.

bound paclitaxel

a Alternative taxanes (ie, docetaxel, paclitaxel, albumin-bound paclitaxel) may be substituted for select patients due to medical necessity (ie, hypersensitivity reaction). If substituted for weekly paclitaxel or docetaxel, then the weekly dose of albumin-bound paclitaxel should not exceed 125 mg/m2.
b Consider scalp cooling to reduce incidence of chemotherapy-induced alopecia for patients receiving chemotherapy. Results may be less effective with anthracyclinecontaining regimens.
c For treatment of brain metastases, see NCCN Guidelines for Central Nervous System Cancers.
d For adult patients with metastatic TNBC who received at least two prior therapies, with at least one line for metastatic disease. For patients with HR positive, HER2 negative cancers after prior treatment including endocrine therapy, a CDK4/6 inhibitor and at least two lines of chemotherapy (including a taxane) for advanced breast cancer.

HER2-Positive Disease, see BINV-Q (2 of 8)
e For patients with tumors that are HER2 IHC 1+ or 2+ and ISH negative, who have received at least 1 prior line of chemotherapy for metastatic disease and, if tumor is HR+, are refractory to endocrine therapy.
f Fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki is contraindicated for patients with pneumonitis or interstitial lung disease (ILD).
g Assess for germline BRCA1/2 mutations in all patients with recurrent or metastatic breast cancer to identify candidates for PARP inhibitor therapy.
h See Additional Targeted Therapies and Associated Biomarker Testing for Recurrent or Stage IV (M1) Disease (BINV-R).
i Sequential single agents are preferred, but chemotherapy combinations may be used in select patients with high tumor burden, rapidly progressing disease, and visceral crisis.

m An FDA-approved biosimilar is an appropriate substitute for trastuzumab. n Fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki may be considered in the first-line setting as
an option for select patients (ie, those with rapid progression within 6 months of neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy [12 months for pertuzumab-containing regimens]). o Fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki is contraindicated for patients with pneumonitis or interstitial lung disease (ILD). p Tucatinib + trastuzumab + capecitabine is preferred in patients with both systemic and CNS progression in the third-line setting and beyond; and it may be given in the second-line setting.

q Multiple lines of concurrent chemotherapy with anti-HER2 therapy (trastuzumab or a TKI) offer clinical benefit for recurrent unresectable HER2+ metastatic breast cancer and have been studied in phase 2 or 3 trials. Clinical experience suggests frequent clinical benefit for such treatment. However, there are no meaningful data for use of any of these regimens among patients previously treated with pertuzumab-based chemotherapy, ado-trastuzumab emtansine, fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki, or trastuzumab/capecitabine/ tucatinib regimens. Thus, the optimal sequence or true benefit of therapy is not known.
r Trastuzumab given in combination with an anthracycline is associated with significant cardiac toxicity. Concurrent use of trastuzumab and pertuzumab with an anthracycline should be avoided.
s Trastuzumab may be safely combined with all non-anthracycline containing preferred and other single agents listed on BINV-Q (1 of 8) for recurrent or metastatic breast cancer.

Note: All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated. Clinical Trials: NCCN believes that the best management of any patient with cancer is in a clinical trial. Participation in clinical trials is especially encouraged.

SYSTEMIC THERAPY REGIMENS FOR RECURRENT UNRESECTABLE (LOCAL OR REGIONAL) OR STAGE IV (M1) DISEASE

Additional Considerations for Those Receiving Systemic Therapy for HER2-Positive Disease • Alternative taxanes (ie, docetaxel, paclitaxel, albumin-bound paclitaxel) may be substituted for select patients due to medical
necessity (ie, hypersensitivity reaction). If substituted for weekly paclitaxel or docetaxel, then the weekly dose of albumin-bound paclitaxel should not exceed 125 mg/m2. • Consider scalp cooling to reduce incidence of chemotherapy-induced alopecia for patients receiving chemotherapy. Results may be less effective with anthracycline-containing regimens. • An FDA-approved biosimilar is an appropriate substitute for trastuzumab. • Trastuzumab and hyaluronidase-oysk injection for subcutaneous use may be substituted for trastuzumab. It has different dosage and administration instructions compared to intravenous trastuzumab. Do not substitute trastuzumab and hyaluronidase-oysk for or with ado-trastuzumab emtansine or fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki. • Pertuzumab, trastuzumab, and hyaluronidase-zzxf injection for subcutaneous use may be substituted anywhere that the combination of intravenous pertuzumab and intravenous trastuzumab are given as part of systemic therapy. Pertuzumab, trastuzumab, and hyaluronidase-zzxf injection for subcutaneous use has different dosing and administration instructions compared to the intravenous products. • Patients previously treated with chemotherapy plus trastuzumab in the absence of pertuzumab in the metastatic setting may be considered for one line of therapy including both trastuzumab plus pertuzumab in combination with or without cytotoxic therapy (such as vinorelbine or taxane). Further research is needed to determine the ideal sequencing strategy for anti-HER2 therapy. • For treatment of brain metastases, see NCCN Guidelines for Central Nervous System Cancers.

The selection, dosing, and administration of anti-cancer agents and the management of associated toxicities are complex. Modifications of drug dose and schedule and initiation of supportive care interventions are often necessary because of expected toxicities and individual patient variability, prior treatment, and comorbidity. The optimal delivery of anti-cancer agents therefore requires a health care delivery team experienced in the use of anticancer agents and the management of associated toxicities in patients with cancer.

a Assess for germline BRCA1/2 mutations in all patients with recurrent or metastatic breast cancer to identify candidates for PARP inhibitor therapy. While olaparib and talazoparib are FDA indicated in HER2-negative disease, the panel supports use in any breast cancer subtype associated with a germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation.
b For HR-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer, assess for PIK3CA mutations with tumor or liquid biopsy to identify candidates for alpelisib plus fulvestrant. PIK3CA mutation testing can be done on tumor tissue or ctDNA in peripheral blood (liquid biopsy). If liquid biopsy is negative, tumor tissue testing is recommended.
c The safety of alpelisib in patients with Type 1 or uncontrolled Type 2 diabetes has not been established.
d See NCCN Guidelines for Management of Immunotherapy-Related Toxicities. e Larotrectinib and entrectinib are indicated for the treatment of solid tumors that have
an NTRK gene fusion without a known acquired resistance mutation and have no satisfactory alternative treatments or that have progressed following treatment.

f Pembrolizumab is indicated for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic, microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) solid tumors, or TMB-H tumors that have progressed following prior treatment and who have no satisfactory alternative treatment options.
g Dostarlimab-gxly is indicated for adult patients with MSI-H/dMMR unresectable or metastatic tumors that have progressed on or following prior treatment and who have no satisfactory alternative treatment options.
h While available data are in the first-line setting, this regimen can be used for second and subsequent lines of therapy if PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor therapy has not been previously used. If there is disease progression while on a PD-1/ PD-L1 inhibitor, there are no data to support an additional line of therapy with another PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor.

i There is also a capsule formulation available. However, do not substitute the capsules for the tablets on a mg-per-mg basis due to differences in dosing and bioavailability.
The selection, dosing, and administration of anti-cancer agents and the management of associated toxicities are complex. Modifications of drug dose and schedule and initiation of supportive care interventions are often necessary because of expected toxicities and individual patient variability, prior treatment, and comorbidity. The optimal delivery of anti-cancer agents therefore requires a health care delivery team experienced in the use of anti-cancer agents and the management of associated toxicities in patients with cancer.

NCCN Guidelines Index Table of Contents Discussion

PRINCIPLES OF MONITORING METASTATIC DISEASE Monitoring of patient symptoms and cancer burden during treatment of metastatic breast cancer is important to determine whether the treatment is providing benefit and that the patient does not have toxicity from an ineffective therapy. Components of Monitoring Monitoring includes periodic assessment of varied combinations of symptoms, physical examination, routine laboratory tests, imaging studies, and blood biomarkers where appropriate. Results of monitoring are classified as response/continued response to treatment, stable disease, uncertainty regarding disease status, or progression of disease. The clinician typically must assess and balance multiple different forms of information to make a determination regarding whether disease is being controlled and the toxicity of treatment is acceptable. Sometimes, this information may be contradictory. Clinicians should take into account patient preferences through a shared decision-making process. Definition of Disease Progression Unequivocal evidence of progression of disease by one or more of these factors is required to establish progression of disease, either because of ineffective therapy or acquired resistance of disease to an applied therapy. Progression of disease may be identified through evidence of growth or worsening of disease at previously known sites of disease and/or of the occurrence of new sites of metastatic disease. • Findings concerning for progression of disease include: Worsening symptoms such as pain or dyspnea Evidence of worsening or new disease on physical examination Declining performance status Unexplained weight loss Increasing alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), or bilirubin Hypercalcemia New radiographic abnormality or increase in the size of pre-existing radiographic abnormality New areas of abnormality on functional imaging (eg, bone scan, PET/CT) Increasing tumor markers (eg, carcinoembryonic antigen [CEA], CA 15-3, CA 27.29)a

a Rising tumor markers (eg, CEA, CA 15-3, CA 27.29) are concerning for tumor progression, but may also be seen in the setting of responding disease. An isolated increase in tumor markers should rarely be used to declare progression of disease. Changes in bone lesions are often difficult to assess on plain or cross-sectional radiology or on bone scan. For these reasons, patient symptoms and serum tumor markers may be more helpful in patients with bone-dominant metastatic disease.

NCCN Guidelines Index Table of Contents Discussion

PRINCIPLES OF MONITORING METASTATIC DISEASE Use of Objective Criteria for Response/Stability/Progression • The most accurate assessments of disease activity typically occur when previously abnormal studies are repeated on a serial and regular
basis. Generally, the same method of assessment should be used over time (eg, an abnormality found on chest CT should generally be monitored with repeat chest CT). • Some non-clinically important variation in measurement of abnormalities by all serial studies is common and expected. Therefore, the use of objective and widely accepted criteria for response, stability, and progression of disease are encouraged. Such systems include the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) guidelines [Eisenhauer EA, Therasse P, Bogaerts J, et al. New response evaluation criteria in solid tumours: revised RECIST guideline (version 1.1). Eur J Cancer 2009;45:228-247] and the WHO criteria (Miller AB, Hoogstraten B, Staquet M, Winkler A. Reporting results of cancer treatment. Cancer 1981;47:207-214). • Studies of functional imaging, such as radionuclide bone scans and PET imaging, are particularly challenging when used to assess response. In the case of bone scans, responding disease may result in a flare or increased activity on the scan that may be misinterpreted as disease progression, especially on the first follow-up bone scan after initiating a new therapy. PET imaging is challenging because of the absence of a reproducible, validated, and widely accepted set of standards for disease activity assessment.

PRINCIPLES OF MONITORING METASTATIC DISEASE Frequency of Monitoring The optimal frequency of repeat testing is uncertain, and is primarily based on the monitoring strategies utilized in breast cancer clinical trials. The frequency of monitoring must balance the need to detect progressive disease, avoid unnecessary toxicity of any ineffective therapy, resource utilization, and determine cost. The following table is to provide guidance, and should be modified for the individual patient based on sites of disease, biology of disease, and treatment regimen. Reassessment of disease activity should be performed in patients with new or worsening signs or symptoms of disease, regardless of the time interval from previous studies.

a IBC is a clinical syndrome in patients with invasive breast cancer that is characterized by erythema and edema (peau d'orange) of a third or more of the skin of the breast. The differential diagnosis includes cellulitis of the breast or mastitis. Pathologically, a tumor is typically present in the dermal lymphatics of the involved skin, but dermal lymphatic involvement is neither required, nor sufficient by itself for a diagnosis of IBC.
b The panel endorses the College of American Pathologists Protocol for pathology reporting for all invasive and noninvasive carcinomas of the breast. http://www.cap.org.

RESPONSE TO PREOPERATIVE THERAPY

TREATMENTk

Responsej

Total mastectomy + level l/ll axillary dissection + RT to chest wall and comprehensive RNI with inclusion of any portion of the undissected axilla at risk ± delayed breast reconstructionl

• Complete planned chemotherapy regimen course if not completed preoperatively plus endocrine treatment if ER-positive and/or PR-positive (sequential chemotherapy followed by endocrine therapy).n
• Complete up to one year of HER2-targeted therapy if HER2-positive (category 1). May be administered concurrently with RTo and with endocrine therapy if indicated.

Consider additional systemic chemotherapym and/or preoperative radiation.

Patients may be candidates for multiple lines of systemic therapy to palliate advanced breast cancer. At each reassessment clinicians should assess value of ongoing treatment, the risks and benefits of an additional line of systemic therapy, patient performance status, and patient preferences through a shared decisionmaking process.

Individualized treatment

j The accurate assessment of in-breast tumor or regional lymph node response to preoperative systemic therapy is difficult, and should include physical examination and performance of imaging studies (mammogram and/or breast MRI) that were abnormal at the time of initial tumor staging. Selection of imaging methods prior to surgery should be determined by the multidisciplinary team.
k Patients with recurrent IBC should be treated according to the guideline for recurrence/stage IV (M1) disease (BINV-19). l See Principles of Breast Reconstruction Following Surgery (BINV-H). m S ee Systemic Therapy Regimens for Recurrent Unresectable (local or regional) or Stage IV (M1) Disease (BINV-Q). n See Adjuvant Endocrine Therapy (BINV-K). o See Principles of Radiation Therapy (BINV-I).
