X-ray Transmission Images of Various Parts of the Body

X-ray Generation
p Two primary methods for X-ray Generation:
■ Rearrangement of atomic-electron configurations “Characteristic” X-rays.
■ The deflection of charged particles in the vicinity of the atomic nucleus “Continuous X-rays or Bremsstrahlung”.
9


Bremsstrahlung X-ray
p Bremsstrahlung radiation
■ Collide with nucleus or paths are close to the nucleus.
■ More common than characteristic radiation.
10


X-ray tube components
p Filament: controls tube current (mA)
p Cathode and focusing cup
p Anode is switched to high potential
■ 30-150kVp
■ Made of tungsten
■ Bremsstrahlung is 1%
■ Heat is 99%
■ Spins at 3,200-3,600 rpm
p Glass housing: vacuum
11


Exposure control
p kVp applied for short duration
■ Fixed timer (silicon controlled rectifier, SCR), or
■ Automatic exposure control (AEC), 5 mm thick ionization chamber
triggers SCR
p Tube current mA controlled by
■ Filament current, and kVp
p mA times exposure time yields mAs
■ mAs measures X-ray exposure
12


kVp = energy mAs = amount
13


Bremsstrahlung (Braking Radiation) Spectrum
p Electrons lose energy through photon emission while being deflected
(decelerated) in the electric field of the atomic nucleus.
p For energies < 100 keV, the photons are emitted at 90 deg to the
direction of the incident electron.
p For higher energies the direction of the emitted radiation is shifted
forward.
14


Radiative vs. Collisional Energy Loss
p Predominant energy loss of electrons at energies below 1 MeV are
collisions leading to excitation and ionization resulting in heat.
p Assuming a tungsten (W, Z=74) target:
■ X-ray diagnostic
p At 100 keV the ratio is about 0.9%, therefore, ~99% of the energy result in heat.
■ Radiation therapy
p At 6 MeV the ratio is about 0.54, therefore, most of the energy results in X-rays.
15


Heel Effect
p Heel effect refers to a reduction in beam intensity toward the
anode side due to the attenuation in the anode.
16


Filtration and Collimation
p Inherent filtration due to tube window (1-2 mm thickness)
made of glass (SiO2) or aluminum, effectively removing all
radiation below 15 keV.
p Added filtration due to added metal sheets to intentionally
adjust the effective energy (main goal is further reduction in
low-energy flux which will be absorbed in patient and only
lead to unnecessary dose).
p Collimators adjust the size and shape of the X-ray field
emerging from the tube port and the additional tungsten due
to internal filament and anode evaporation.
p Compensation or equalization filters are used to deliver a
more uniform exposure to the detector compensating
inhomogeneous attenuation in the patient.
17


Compensation filters
p Goal: to even out film exposure

INTERACTIONS OF X-RAYS
20


Interaction of X-rays with Tissues
p Primary radiation: a certain fraction of X-rays pass straight through the body and undergo no interactions with tissue.
p Secondary radiation: X-rays can be scattered, an interaction that alters their trajectory between source and detector.
p Absorbed radiation: X-rays can be absorbed completely in tissue and not reach the detector at all.
21


Interactions in Diagnostic Radiology
p In the X-ray energy range (25–150 keV) used for diagnostic radiology, three dominant mechanisms describe the interaction of X-rays with tissue:
■ Coherent scatter and Compton scatter are both involved in the production of secondary radiation.
■ Photoelectric interactions result in Xray absorption.
22


Rayleigh Scattering
p Elastic (coherent, classical) scattering
■ Scatter with direction change but no energy loss.
hυincident = hυscattered ;
λincident = λscattered
p Characteristics
■ An interaction of the x-ray with the entire atom via a refractory mechanism (wavelength ~ atomic radius).
■ Occurs for longer wavelengths (low x-ray energies in the mammography range - 15 - 30keV).
■ Reduces imaging quality in x-ray imaging. E(keV) P(%)
~30 <12
>70 <5
P: probability


Compton Scattering
p Compton scattering refers to the interaction between an incident X-ray and a loosely bound electron in an outer shell of an atom in tissue.
p A fraction of the X-ray energy is transferred to the electron, the electron is ejected, and the X-ray is deflected from its original path.
p The probability of an X-ray undergoing Compton scattering is
■ Essentially independent of the effective atomic number of the tissue.
■ Linearly proportional to the tissue electron density.
■ Weakly dependent on the energy of the incident X-ray.
24


Photoelectric Effect (I)
p Photoelectric interactions in the body involve the energy of an incident X-ray being absorbed by an atom in tissue, with a tightly bound electron being emitted from the K or L shell as a “photoelectron.”
p The kinetic energy of the photoelectron is equal to the difference between the energy of the incident X-ray and the binding energy of the electron.
p A second electron from a higher energy level then fills the “hole” created by the ejection of the photoelectron, a process accompanied by the emission of a “characteristic” X-ray with an energy equal to the difference in the binding energies of the outer electron and the photoelectron.

• Primary X-rays pass between the lead
septa, whereas those X-rays that have
undergone a significant deviation in
trajectory from Compton scattering are
absorbed by the septa.

Stationary grids
p You can change the mAs or the kVp to compensate the grids, but
it is not recommended to do both.
p Grids clean up scatter, they do not create scatter.
p Know the grid ratios!!
Grid Ratio mAs increase kVp increase

■ Typical range 3< GCF < 8
p Grid visible on X-ray film
■ Move grid during exposure
■ Linear or circular motion

p Film stops light really well
p Phosphor (calcium tungstate CaWO4) transforms x-ray photons into light photons.
p Flash of light lasts second.
p About 1,000 light photons per 50 keV X-ray photon.

34


Intensifying Screen
p The intrinsic sensitivity of photographic film to X-rays is very low,
■ i.e., its use would require high patient doses of radiation to produce highquality images.
Effect of the thickness of the intensifying screen
on the spatial resolution of the image. 35


X-ray Image Intensifier — used in fluoroscopy
p Image intensifier, coupled to camera
p At phosphor screen: X-rays converted into light; at photocathode: then
into electrons.
p Electrons accelerated and focused in tube with electromagnetic fields.
p Converted back into light at output screen, coupled to camera.
p Advantages:
■ Dynamic real-time imaging
p Disadvantages:
■ Worse spatial resolution (camera) ■ More noise (conversions) ■ Geometric pin cushion ■ Distortion, especially at edges
36


Digital radiology
p Replace the intensifying screen/X-ray film by
■ Flat panel detectors (FPD) using thin-film transistor (TFT) arrays.
■ A scintillator
p Consisting of many thin, rod-shaped cesium iodide (CsI) crystals.
p When an X-ray is absorbed in a CsI rod, the CsI scintillate and produces light.
p The light is converted into an electrical signal by a photodiode in the TFT array.
p The electrical signal is amplified and converted to a digital value using an A/D converter.
p A typical commercial DR system has flat panel dimensions of 41x41 cm, with an TFT array of 2048x2048 elements.

■ Detector does not faithfully reproduce the incident intensity.
■ X-rays arrive in discrete packets of energy. This discrete nature can lead to fluctuations in the image.

Example
p Suppose an X-ray tube is set up to fire bursts of photons each with N=10000 photons and the detector’s output (# of detected photons per burst) x has a mean =8000, variance=40000. What is its DQE?
p Solution:
■ The actual # of photons fired at the X-ray tube follows the Poisson process (mean=variance=10000)
■ The # of detected photons has mean=8000, variance=40000
■ This means that only about 16%of photons are detected correctly.
SNRin = mean / variance = 10000 = 100
SNRout = mean / variance = 8000/ 40000 = 40
DQE = (

Summary
p Projection radiography system consists of an x-ray tube, devices for beam filtration and restriction, compensation filters, grids, and a filmscreen detector (or digital detector, filmless).
p The detector reading (or image gray level) is proportional to the number of unabsorbed x-ray photons arriving at the detector, which depends on the overall attenuation in the path from the source to the detector.
p The above relation must be modified to take into account of inverse square law, obliquity, anode heel effect, extended source and detector impulse response.
p Both detector noise and Compton scattering reduce contrast and SNR of the formed image. 76

Nuclear radiation results from unstable nuclei
p Nuclear stability is a balance between electromagnetic repulsion of protons and strong force interaction among all nucleons (protons and neutrons).
p There are ~ 2,450 isotopes of the ~ 100 elements in the Periodic Table, ~300 of which are naturally occurring, the others are human-made.
p Several mechanisms for unstable nuclei to decay to stable isotopes: fission, α-, β-, γ-emission, e- capture.
p Frequently there are multiple decay steps to reach stability.
p Each decay step is described by an exponential process with a characteristic decay time —-> Half-life of the isotope.
■ : half-life

Decay Modes
p Four main modes of decay
■ alpha particles (2 protons, 2 neutrons)
■ beta particles (electrons)
■ positrons (anti-matter electrons)
■ isometric transition (gamma rays produced)

p Radioactive decay, emits an alpha particle (two protons and two neutrons bound together into a helium nucleus)
p Alpha decay occurs most often in massive nuclei that have too large a proton to neutron ratio. Alpha radiation reduces the ratio of protons to neutrons in the parent nucleus, bringing it to a more stable configuration.
p mono-energetic
p Loses energy in a more or less continuous slowing down process as it travels through matter.
p The distance it travels (range) depends only upon its initial energy and its average energy loss rate in the medium.
p The range for an α particle emitted in tissue is on the order of microns.
α decay (not used for imaging)
103


Beta decay
p Occurs when too many protons or too many neutrons in a
nucleus, one of the protons or neutrons is transformed into the
other.
p Mass number A does not change after decay, proton number Z
increases or decreases.
p Beta minus decay (or simply Beta decay): A neutron changes
into a proton, an electron (beta particle) and an antineutrino.
n → p + e− + ν ̄

Positron decay and electron capture
pAlso known as Beta Plus decay
pA proton changes to a neutron, a positron (positive electron), and a neutrino (P -> n+β++ν)
pMass number A does not change, proton number Z reduces.
pPositron: antimatter electron
pNeutrino, emitted with positron, a massless, chargeless subatomic particle.
pThe positron may later annihilate a free electron, generate two gamma photons in opposite directions.
pThese gamma rays are used for medical imaging (Positron Emission Tomography).
pElectron capture: P+e- -> n+ν. 105


Gamma decay (isometric transition)
p A nucleus (which is unstable) changes from a higher energy
state to a lower energy state through the emission of
electromagnetic radiation (photons) (called gamma rays).
■ The daughter and parent atoms are isomers.
■ The gamma photon is used in Single photon emission computed
tomography (SPECT)
p Gamma rays have the same property as X-rays, but are
generated different:
■ X-ray through energetic electron interactions
■ Gamma-ray through isometric transition in nucleus.

Statistics of decay
p The exponential decay law only gives the expected number of atoms at a
certain time .
p The number of disintegrated atoms over a short time after time
with atoms follows Poisson distribution
p can be interpreted as the probabilities of having 1 disintegration
from all atoms during interval .
p is called the Poisson rate.

Radiotracers
p Decay mode:
■ Desire clean gamma decay: do not emit alpha or beta particles.
■ Positron decay: positron will annihilate with electrons to produce gamma rays.
p Energy of photon:
■ Should be high so that can leave the body w/ little attenuation.
■ Hard to detect if the energy is too high.
■ Desired energy range: 70-511 KeV.
p Half-life
■ Should not be too short (before detector can capture) or too long (longer patient scan time).
■ Minutes to hours desired.
p Monoenergetic
■ Energy sensitive detectors can discriminate the primary photons from scattered ones.

Summary
p Nuclear medicine relies on radiation (gamma rays) generated through
radioactive decay.
■ Radioactive decay is the process when a unstable nuclide is changed to a more stable one.
p Four modes of decay, generating alpha particles, beta particles, positrons and
gamma rays respectively.
p Radioactivity follows an exponential decay law, characterized by the decay
constant or the half-life.
p Desired properties for radio tracers.
